The impact of the internet, digital devices, and online activities on the environment is a growing concern that is being addressed by more and more sectors. The Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius requires us to reduce our carbon footprint significantly. However, while the internet has many benefits for society, it may not be able to contribute as much to this goal if we don't take action to limit its environmental impact. According to various studies, the internet currently accounts for 3-4% of national emissions levels. Beyond carbon emissions, other environmental impacts associated with the internet include water consumption and energy use. GreenIT.fr warns that beyond climate change concerns, our overall ecological footprint is also increasing rapidly due to increased consumption in all areas of life fueled by technology advancement (e.g., data storage and processing). The Arcep has decided to take full advantage of its mission in order to address this issue by focusing on reducing our carbon footprint through innovative technologies such as blockchain technology. By doing so, we can help prevent global temperatures from reaching dangerous levels while also preserving our environment for future generations The Autorité de régulation des communications électroniques (Arcep) is a French government agency that focuses on the regulation of digital services and networks. In 2019, the Arcep published a note called "L'emmental du numérique n'est pas forcément preinte carbone du numérique" which suggests that users of digital services and networks are in control of their choices regarding how their technology affects the environment, rather than being bound by technological constraints. This perspective is part of an overall effort by the Arcep to open up its regulatory work to include more stakeholders in order to better respond to changing social and environmental conditions. Eight online meetings were held between July and November 2020 in order to bring together representatives from various sectors involved in digital life, with the goal of developing joint strategies for sustainable development. The text discusses a number of topics related to the concept of digital sustainability. Among these are the importance of networks and communication technologies in today's society, how to create a sustainable online environment, and ways to make networks more equitable. In addition, the text discusses how regulators are working to ensure that communications technologies are sustainable. Finally, it provides a brief overview of two upcoming discussions focused on digital sustainability: one being organized by European regulators, the other being led by the Arcep (the French national regulator for telecommunications and information systems).

The main points covered in this summary are as follows: 

1) The Autorité de régulation des communications électroniques (Arcep) is a French government agency that focuses on regulating digital services and networks. 
2) In 2019, the Arcep published a note called "L'emmental du numérique n'est pas forcément preinte carbone du numérique" which suggests that users have control over how their technology affects both themselves and ecosystems around them- instead of being bound by technological constraints. 
3) The Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI) predicts that by 2023, the number of devices connected to the internet will have reached 29.3 billion worldwide. This growth is due in part to the increasing use of “internet of things” (IoT) devices, which allow for a multitude of services and content to be accessed through physical objects such as televisions and computers. The majority of French households (approximately 60%) are currently equipped with at least one device connected to the internet, with smartphones accounting for the largest share (approximately 50%). The digital age is progressing rapidly, but there are still many challenges that need to be overcome in order for it to truly take off. One of these challenges is the lack of enough electricity to power all the new devices and services that are being created. According to a study by the International Data Corporation (IDC), by 2020, only 8% of the world's population will be able to access the internet via traditional means such as landlines and TVs. Instead, most people will be using digital devices such as phones and computers. This increase in digital usage has led to an increase in data traffic on networks around the world. In 2017, IP Global transit- ing on mobile networks accounted for 16% of total global traffic, and by 2022 this figure is expected to reach 57%. The growth in video consumption can be attributed in part to this increased data traffic. More people are now connecting to the internet via their mobile phones than ever before, which has led to an increase in content and services available online. In terms of digital marketing, there has been an increase in subscription-based video streaming services, such as VàDA (video à la demande par abonnement), which offer pop-up advertisements. Additionally, the percentage of people who use their phones



to watch videos online has increased overall by 11 points in one or more formats,,such as video,,banners,,etc.. This trend is also reflected inthe The text discusses the various ways in which electronic communications technologies can impact the environment. It notes that, while technology can play a role in reducing emissions, it is not the only factor at play. Other factors, such as the way an individual uses technology and how much energy they consume overall, also need to be considered. One key point made in the text is that electronic communications technologies are often driven by global trends rather than local needs. This means that even if a particular country adopts environmentally-friendly technology standards, other countries with less stringent standards may still produce more emissions because of their reliance on imported goods and services. Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of how electronic communications technologies can impact both the environment and human health. The digital world is having a significant impact on the environment, with 75% of all resources consumed by the digital sector. To ensure an efficient government and citizenry, it is necessary to better understand the environmental impacts of the digital sector. This is where studies like those mentioned in this article come in handy, as they help policymakers make informed decisions about how to best regulate the industry. The text discusses the various ways in which researchers are trying to measure the environmental impact of the digital world. One method is to look at how much carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced as a result of using digital technologies. A study published in 2018 found that, on average, digital technologies produce 16% of CO2 emissions compared to 81% for traditional physical technologies. Another study published last year estimated that, globally, 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions come from digital technology use. These estimates vary depending on the geographical area being studied and the type of data analysis used. Overall, though, it appears that digital technology is having a significant impact on the environment and policymakers need to develop strategies for mitigating its effects. Digital technology has the potential to have a significant impact on carbon emissions, but there is still much to be learned about how this affects the environment. Researchers need to develop standardized measurement tools and strategies for evaluating digital technology's impacts, as well as develop ways to minimize rebound effects from technological innovations. Additionally, waste management and energy efficiency are important issues that need attention if we want to reduce our reliance on coal-based energy sources. The text discusses the importance of communication and collaboration between experts in the environment, technology, and communication fields in order to create environmentally-friendly products. The study of experience between these various actors is essential for developing measures to mitigate the environmental impacts of electronic communications. In France, the ADEME plays an important role in this process by providing guidelines for sustainable use of information technologies. Recently, the UIT published a set of recommendations on assessing environmental impact (recommendation ITU-T L.147074). Authorities need to better understand and address the environmental impacts of digital technologies, and outline various ways in which they can do so. The Arcep has launched a platform called "Soutenable" in order to facilitate dialogues between interested parties regarding the environmental impacts of digital transformations. The goal of this platform is to bring together representatives from various sectors (including businesses, technology providers, and environmental organizations) in order to discuss common challenges and opportunities related to the impact of digital technologies on the environment. In September 2020, sixty-five participants responded to an invitation from the Arcep and discussed key priorities for addressing the environmental implications of digital transformation. Among these topics were adapting commercial practices related to electronic waste management, choosing appropriate network infrastructure for a sustainable internet, and creating more efficient use of resources through targeted content consumption. Finally, in October 2020, an online space was created called "Numeriquesoutenable.arcep.fr" which served as a forum for participants to share their insights and experiences with regard to these issues. 

The Arcep is currently working on a project called "Soutenable Numérique," which aims to create a dialogue between digital participants that is sustainable and manageable. During the first round of these workshops, which took place in September and October, participants discussed topics such as how to connect digitally for networks without sacrificing sustainability or user freedom. In addition, open source software and data storage solutions were also explored. The second round of workshops will be dedicated to more specific policy questions, and will take place in November 2020. The text discusses the various implications of asynchronous commercial times for businesses. Specifically, the platform "For a Sustainably Digital World" (numeriquesoutenable.arcep.fr) offered participants the opportunity to share their thoughts on how best to create continuity between different models of marketing and sales. The Arcep found that many participants had strong opinions on how best to approach commercial practices, with some advocating for more restraint while others calling for increased incentives and advertising strategies that align with market values. Overall, the discussion yielded several insights into how businesses can improve their current marketing strategies while also taking into account the impact of rapidly changing technology on customer behavior. Terminals can be an interesting alternative to traditional consumer electronics when the offer does not incent consumers to replace their devices frequently. In the case of smartphones, for example, a frequent replacement of devices (due to obsolescence) has negative environmental consequences. Participants discussed various models of obsolescence and their impacts on the environment in detail. Some recommendations included distinguishing between "cultural" and "real" obsolescence, characterizing "logistical" and "technical" obsolescence, and identifying ways to combat each type of degradation. Participants also offered recommendations on how to manage software updates, design user interfaces that are easy to use across different platforms, and recycle or reuse obsolete technology products. Overall, these discussions highlighted the importance of taking into account all forms of technological obsolescence when designing solutions aimed at mitigating its effects on the environment This workshop provided a comprehensive overview of the issues surrounding obsolescence and offered strategies for managing it. In this third and final workshop, participants discussed the potential environmental impacts of various IoT technologies. Some key points that were raised include the fact that wireless networks are more energy-intensive than fixed networks, and that devices using older technology such as 2G and 3G can have a significant impact on the environment. Several strategies for reducing environmental impact were also discussed, including encouraging users to adopt more sustainable practices, implementing automatic power management tools, and restricting data usage in order to reduce network load. Finally, it was noted that manufacturers and system operators should play an important role in promoting environmentally-friendly use of IoT technologies by helping users make informed choices about which network to use. The text discusses the potential consequences of extinction of mobile networks 2G and 3G. It notes that these networks are already obsolete due to the increasing use of 4G networks, which are more energy-efficient. Several practical reasons for keeping 2G and 3G networks alive have been identified, including the fact that they are still widely used, many devices are still incompatible with 4G networks, and certain services (such as video streaming) would be difficult to provide without them. While there is some debate over whether or not mobile networks should be eliminated altogether in favor of more sustainable technologies, it is clear that they have a significant impact on energy consumption and must be taken into account when making decisions about online services and content. The text discusses the environmental impact of digital services and content. Several participants identified the need to include a phase of production for terminals in assessing environmental impacts – which should also exceed only questions related to carbon footprint . They also emphasized the need for an eco-design approach that takes into account user preferences and scenarios . In addition , they noted that certain digital services – such as video streaming or virtual reality – require different levels of constraint depending on their typeof content: e -commerce , virtual reality , or social media use respectively . Finally In this workshop, participants discussed ways to improve the environmental impact of digital usage/service. They noted that while certain technologies (such as small cells or network architecture) can have a significant impact on reducing energy consumption, others (such as mutualization or data sharing) may have a negative effect on other aspects of network performance. In order to make the most effective use of these various tools, it is important to understand the coverage and traffic patterns of individual networks. This knowledge can be used to optimize network performance in specific areas based on need. Finally, the participants discussed how users should expect cooperation between different networking tools to result in a net positive effect for both user and environment. The workshop focused on the links between cybersecurity and environmental issues, with participants discussing how technology can have both positive and negative impacts on society. The discussion highlighted the importance of taking into account the social and environmental impacts of our everyday choices, with participants noting that "individual responsibility should not be substituted for that of the state" when it comes to matters such as smartphone purchases or video streaming. However, this assertion was tempered by comments noting that new technologies require a collective effort before any real progress can be made in terms of understanding or addressing user concerns. Some discussions centered on the need for clear social and environmental standards governing what constitutes a quality product or service, while others raised concerns about government overreach if it attempts to micromanage every aspect of users' lives. Still other participants advocated for more direct action aimed at reducing environmental impact and carbon emissions from our everyday activities. Though these are just starting points, the discussion provides food for thought as we continue to grapple with how technology affects society both positively and negatively. Cybersecurity and the environment are two important fields that need to be taken into account when developing policies related to digital services. Cyberattacks can have negative impacts on both physical security and the environment, and policymakers need to take these impacts into account when making decisions. ADEME is working on projects related to eco-conception and environmental impact assessment, which will help reduce the amount of resources used in relation to services rendered while also creating jobs that are not easily outsourced or relocated. The text discusses the importance of understanding both the products that are produced and the users who use them in order to reduce environmental impacts. It also discusses how digital technologies play an important role in all three axes mentioned above, by facilitating communication between people and businesses, providing access to data, accelerating calculations, and reducing waste. Finally, it calls for people to work effectively with its potential as a lever of environmental transition.

In summary, the text discusses how understanding both the products that are produced and the users who use them is essential in order to reduce environmental impacts; digital technologies play an important role in all three axes mentioned above; and effective measures must be taken at every stage of the value chain in order to achieve a sustainable digital economy. The European Union is changing its economic model in order to be more transparent and fair for businesses and to promote efficiency within the single market. Different approaches will be necessary depending on the type of products and market (B2B, B2C). French law passed in 2020, which aims to reduce waste and improve environmentalism, is an important step in this process. The EU's new consumer agenda, released in 2021, will also have legal implications. It is important to take into account existing legislation when developing strategies to reduce carbon footprints. For example, calculating emissions using ACV data would help identify specific areas where reductions are needed most. Overall, making ACV data available for public consumption would provide a more accurate picture of corporate carbon footprints.

We have a number of historical groups speaking on behalf of the public, which makes it difficult to collect data that is finer and more specific to the needs of businesses in the digital age: growth, which can together push all of the ecosystem's 1h streaming in HD? Between 18 and 400 gCO2eq more transparency. According to studies and countries... With carbon transparency, consumers and businesses 1h on social media? First we need to know can, each at their level,... The Group Altitude is concerned about climate change and wants to participate in expert groups focused on environmental topics. They believe that mobile usage should be a major focus of discussion, along with other non-material aspects of our lives beyond just material possessions. They urge the Authority to stimulate action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by focusing primarily on known and reliable methods such as reducing energy consumption. Regarding waste management, The Group pledges to accelerate its actions over 2021 and has begun recruiting staff specifically focused on this area. The text discusses the potential impacts of digital technologies on the environment, and highlights the importance of properly assessing their impact before taking any action that could potentially reduce their benefits. The Avicca (an organization representing public sector entities) is interested in participating in these discussions and has already established partnerships with private sector actors to this end. Finally, the text provides insights into how digital technologies are transforming many aspects of our lives, from our physical environment to our social interactions The text discusses the importance of management practices that are sustainable, and points out that this is an increasingly important issue as the effects of the digital revolution continue to grow. The model for business that is most likely to be able to combine social and environmental impacts in a positive way is one that takes into account both the economic interests of organizations and their long-term sustainability. It is difficult, however, for producers to maintain ownership over their products in a world where data is constantly being generated. This will lead to increased energy consumption as well as negative impacts on organizational sustainability. The two main issues raised by the text are the need for businesses to develop values that appeal to customers and the equation of value used by companies in order to make profits from their activities. We will discuss these topics below.

First, it is necessary for businesses to create values that are relevant and meaningful to consumers. This can be done through creating products with high quality standards while also taking into account environmental concerns such as reducing energy consumption or waste production. Second, companies must find an equation of value that allows them make money from their activities while also protecting shareholder interests. There are many ways this can be accomplished, but ultimately it requires understanding how people use information technology and making strategic decisions based on this knowledge Bouygues Telecom believes that it is essential to take into account both the social and environmental impacts of business operations when developing marketing strategies. To do this, the company has developed a training program for marketeers who want to be more responsible with their marketing practices. Additionally, Bouygues Telecom is working to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases while also expanding its network capacity in order not only meet customer demand but also improve efficiency across all aspects of its operations The text discusses the importance of reducing environmental impact, and how the development of technology has its own environmental consequences. The main points made are that although 5G represents an improvement in terms of network speed and efficiency, it does not have a significant potential for innovation when it comes to reducing consumer energy consumption or improving sustainability. Consumers may be held responsible for climate change due to their increased demand for data and services. Despite this limitation, the text argues that action on climate change still requires an increase in consumption levels, as opposed to relying solely on technological advances to solve the problem. The text discusses the need for policymakers to focus on reducing environmental impact when developing and implementing innovative technologies. It outlines three main principles that should guide this effort: minimizing the number of different technology platforms in use, focusing on low-tech solutions, and promoting sustainable practices. Finally, it argues that public interest should be a central concern when it comes to innovation policies.

Overall, the text discusses the importance of digital technology and how it should be used in a responsible way. It stresses the need for us to focus on only those uses of digital technology that help us maintain our resilience as communites. Furthermore, it is important to preserve democracy in any process related to digital technology, and this has been largely unsuccessful so far due to government efforts focused on "sensibilizing" consumers instead of taking real action.

In order to break from current strategies and approaches and move towards more effective solutions that take into account all aspects of our environment, France should play a more significant role in this than that currently being done by other countries. Covage is a technology company that specializes in deploying copper networks on its customers' historical networks. This represents our first step towards reducing our carbon emissions on our individual networks. Fiber also has the potential to improve energy efficiency by connecting mobile and connected devices together. The provision of our services to our active customers constitutes Covage's second-largest source of CO2 emissions. In 2020, Covage aims to reduce its major sources of emissions even further by implementing environmental and responsible practices at every level of its operations: transportation, waste disposal, water consumption, and energy use. Additionally, Covage supports social initiatives with the donation of reusable materials and equipment to refugees, as well as funding projects aimed at compensating for CO2 emissions caused by uncompressed digital files. By monitoring key components such as CO2 emissions from transportation, waste disposal, water consumption, and energy usage along with social initiatives such as recycling rates and public awareness about climate change among employees, Covage hopes to create a more sustainable future for all. Today, the average individual spends 3 hours and 30 minutes per day watching television. Additionally, radio is still widely listened to, with 40.9 million people using it daily. A new reference guide on media usage will be published soon which will include information on digital media use by French citizens aged 10 and over. Digital media consumption has increased in recent years, with video streaming representing 60% of all internet traffic. This trend is likely to continue as more high-speed networks and connected devices are installed in homes. It is important to consider both the user interface design issues that arise from the impact of technology on our environment when thinking about digital sustainability initiatives. The text discusses the various ways in which digital technology can have a negative impact on the environment, and offers suggestions on how designers of digital content and services can make their products more environmentally friendly. One key point made is that it is now important for designers to consider the environmental impacts of their virtual reality productions as well as the overall efficiency of their online systems. It is also important to remember that users are not static entities who will always use technology in the same way; instead, they are constantly evolving and changing their habits, which requires designers to keep up with these changes. Finally, Ericsson stresses the importance of collective action when it comes to addressing issues related to digital sustainability. The text discusses the various ways in which the digital age is impacting the environment, and how we need to be aware of these impacts in order to make informed decisions about how best to proceed The text discusses the importance of digital technologies in helping to reduce carbon emissions. One main point made is that while technology has its own set of environmental impacts, it is important to consider the overall impact that these technologies have when used in conjunction with other forms of production and consumption. In addition, the text highlights the importance of public education in order to encourage users to make informed choices about their technology use. Finally, Facebook's goal of becoming completely renewable by 2020 should be seen as an example for other technological companies as well. The text discusses the importance of transitioning to a more sustainable digital economy, and highlights the need for greater efficiency in data consumption. It points out that while progress has been made in this area, we still have a long way to go before we reach an energy-efficient equilibrium. One way to achieve this is through the development of more efficient data architectures, which would compensate for the explosion in data consumption. Prospective technologies that are currently being marketed at large scale (5G and 8K displays, autonomous vehicles, etc.) require careful planning due to their significant environmental impacts. At the same time, these high-usage applications should not be allowed to take precedence over more sustainable resources. The challenge is balancing these competing interests while also ensuring that citizens or NGOs have access to transparent information about them. This poses a major economic issue as it displaces investments into fossil fuels. However, it is important to remember that sustainability cannot be achieved without taking into account social implications – something which requires public input and engagement on a large scale. The digital age is having a significant impact on ecosystems and human societies, and there is a growing need for solutions that take both of these factors into account. One way to improve resilience against such risks is to consider ACV (actual cost of technology) when making decisions about technologies. Digital ecosystems are important in reducing environmental impact, as they allow for the integration of different sectors to create more innovative and sustainable products. Companies such as Google and Apple are making efforts to reduce their environmental impact through a variety of methods, including using renewable energy sources and eliminating plastic from packaging. In 2025, data centers will be able to provide more power through computational advances while also eliminating waste from cooling systems. YouTube aims to provide an optimal viewing experience for each user, with features like automatic playback that can be disabled at any time. Every user is able to see how long they watched a video and whether they paused it or had it timed-out using their profile's stats page. These tools are designed help users better understand how they use YouTube and disconnect if needed while also providing guidance on how long videos should be watched before being deleted. The text discusses the importance of being mindful of our digital resources and how to conserve them responsibly, highlighting the negative impacts that overuse of digital media has on both the environment and humanity. It offers advice on how to create sustainable online habits for all members of the family, including tips on reducing energy consumption and teaching children about the importance of conserving resources. Finally, it provides some tips for businesses who want to make their online presence more environmentally friendly. The text discusses the two main types of obsolescence that affect electronic equipment: physical obsolescence, which is caused by the wear and tear on the equipment itself, and logical obsolescence, which is due to the expiration of software or hardware capabilities. Both forms of obsolescence are becoming more common as technology evolves and newer, more advanced versions of software and hardware become available. In order to combat these issues, HOP/Halte à l’obsolescence programmée calls for policies that promote an extended lifespan for electronics devices as well as increased reuse and reconditioning opportunities. Additionally, a usage meter for electronic products would help consumers better understand how their devices are being used and could lead to increased demand for secondhand electronics. The text discusses the importance of innovation in the culture sector, and how it is essential to address current environmental challenges. It highlights the need for companies to develop sustainable practices when making digital investments, and calls for greater transparency from those responsible for software updates. The article also urges policymakers to consider ways to incentivize sustainable consumption habits among consumers, and provide training for company leaders on how best to manage digital resources responsibly. Finally, it recommends developing a common measurement toolkit to track and report on cultural uses of technology that have negative environmental impacts.

MAIN POINTS: 

-Physical obsolescence (wear & tear) & logical obsolescence (software/hardware expiration) are both becoming more common with advancing technology -HOP/Halte à l'obsolescence programmée advocates policies that promote an extended lifespan & increased reuse/reconditioning opportunities -Les Augures collective plans work with other stakeholders (& eco-organizations) towards rational use of resources while promoting waste prevention & recycling initiatives -MEL seeks sustainability through its own practices (& working with others) The text discusses the importance of technologies such as satellite Internet in order to improve our environment. Satellite Internet offers high-speed connections that are already integrated into an environmentally responsible and sustainable approach. It is important to take these types of technologies into account when planning our infrastructure, in order to reduce the amount of resources we consume and make it easier to compare results from different studies. Additionally, satellite technology can be used to manage data centers more efficiently and reduce their environmental impact. Satellite internet is a reliable and affordable way to access the internet from anywhere in the world. It is especially useful for people who live in remote or rural areas, or who have difficulty accessing traditional internet services. Numerisat believes that consumers should have more control over their online habits, and that they should be encouraged to use less-expensive, longer-lasting technology products. To this end, Numerisat has developed strategies aimed at reducing consumer consumption while also increasing the lifespan of its products. These include developing adaptive pricing schemes that are tailored to individual users’ needs, as well as recycling and reusing equipment when possible.

The company has been committed to reducing its environmental impact since it was founded in 1995, and aims to achieve "zero emissions" by 2030. To do this, OVHcloud is focusing its efforts on five key areas: the environmental impact of industry, the design of infrastructure for renewable energy, promotion of circular economy practices within the company, mobilizing its stakeholders towards sustainability, and continuous innovation in cycles shortening. Significant efforts have been made by the industry as a whole to reduce environmental impact; however OVHcloud stands out due to its own initiative in building their own servers and using renewable energy sources which helps them achieve their goal faster than other companies . Data centers use a lot of energy , but this trend is only going to continue as cloud computing becomes more popular with companies like OVHcloud aiming for "zero emissions" by 2030 through initiatives such as using renewable energy sources . Overall satellite internet remains an affordable , reliable ,and accessible way for people all around the world to connect with each other online The text discusses the importance of data accuracy in order to make sound business decisions. It points out that while data availability is improving, it still lacks certain key details from some of the major players in the industry. In order to make this transition as smooth as possible, it is important to have a clear understanding of what sustainability looks like in the digital age. To do this, researchers need access to data on environmental impacts across all industries, not just the digital one. Furthermore, we need to raise awareness about how our consumption habits affect our environment – especially when it comes to electronics and energy use. Finally, we need to create a pathway into mainstream adoption of good web practices – such as accessibility and security – so that all companies can benefit from them. The text discusses the importance of accurate data in order to make smart decisions about operations. It urges businesses to collaborate with government officials and other stakeholders in order to create a more sustainable future for all involved. Finally, it emphasizes the need for businesses to be proactive when designing future digital systems – taking into account both environmental and social factors. The text discusses the importance of environmental and social responsibility in business, and how it is essential for companies to regain the trust of their customers. The text discusses the importance of limiting the use of unlimited data plans offered by telecommunications providers, and discouraging practices that are abusive or unfair towards consumers. It also stresses the need for companies to take responsibility for their impact on the environment, and to make significant changes in how they approach digital consumption in order to be more environmentally sustainable. Tibco, a company that has been involved in repairing electronic cards since its creation 36 years ago, is now working towards becoming a responsible digital citizen by promoting sustainable uses of technology across all aspects of its business. Some of Tibco's current actions include transitioning its fleet to electric vehicles, digitizing contracts and documents, and raising awareness about good digital habits among its employees. In the text, we are discussing the various ways in which Tibco is working to become more environmentally friendly. One of these ways is by transitioning to using green energy sources. Tibco has also committed itself to being a responsible corporate citizen by taking measures such as implementing sustainable practices in its accounting and financial systems. In addition, Tibco is working on developing a comprehensive system-wide strategy that will encompass all aspects of its business operations. Finally, it is important to remember that humans are also integral part of this equation - everyone at Tibco must be mindful of their health and well-being while carrying out their work duties, and the company will continue to prioritize protecting human resources throughout this transformation process. The text discusses the importance of reducing emissions from telecommunications networks, and provides examples of how this can be done. One way to reduce emissions is to use wired or wireless networks that are more energy efficient than cell phones. The Arcep has proposed a number of actions that could be taken to build sustainable telecommunications networks, including developing standards and implementing taxes or subsidies. The digital world has summarized all the above text while maintaining all relevant information from it. Break down the text into its main components, identify the most important points and concepts, and craft a summary that is concise yet comprehensive at the same time. Make sure your summary accurately conveys the original message of the text while also providing readers with a high-level overview of what they can expect to find in the text. Ensure that the summary is well-structured and easy to comprehend, with no unnecessary details or filler The digital age has had a significant environmental impact, and policymakers need to take this into account when regulating the industry. Three key pillars are necessary to help reduce the environmental impact of the digital age: better data collection, analysis, and action; stronger incentives for businesses and users to reduce their online footprint; and increased responsibility on all stakeholders involved in the digital ecosystem. Data collection is essential for understanding how much an individual's online activity impacts the environment. However, current data gathering mechanisms are not sufficient. Therefore, policymakers need to develop more detailed measurements of an individual's online footprint in order to make informed decisions about how best to regulate the industry. Incentives are also needed to encourage businesses and users to reduce their environmental impact. These incentives should be tailored specifically for each sector or type of user behavior. For example, one proposal suggests providing financial rewards for companies that achieve lower energy consumption or emissions levels. Finally, all stakeholders must be responsible for reducing their own environmental impact when using technology. This includes both individuals and companies who design and deploy technology products/services. The text discusses the various factors that influence the environmental impact of networks, including the consumption of users, type of services used, and so on. It is noted that beyond this, it is also important to note how regular references are made to production being the most important stage for network-related emissions due to equipment used in communications (such as internet service providers or phone companies) producing a large majority of greenhouse gas emissions during this stage. Other key players in network production include manufacturers of telecommunications devices and content delivery networks (CDNs). These third parties can either operate directly through their distributors or work together with established telecom carriers The text discusses the importance of using "regulation by data" in order to better understand and manage environmental issues related to user choices in the digital world. This approach involves collecting data from users in order to better understand their preferences and behaviors, and then using this information to guide public policy decisions. One important step in this process is ensuring that data is collected systematically and accurately, so that it can be used effectively to inform users' choices and spur action on behalf of policymakers. In 2019, several regulatory bodies issued a report recommending the use of regulation by data as a way to improve transparency and reduce asymmetries of information across different stakeholders. The group of generals, in order to discuss transversal topics and steer work and discussions in common. This group is currently composed of eight institutions. The text discusses the importance of collecting data from operators of communications networks in order to better understand the impact that digital technologies have on the environment. Various indicators are proposed as ways to measure this impact, and it is important to collect data from a variety of sources in order to get a comprehensive picture. In addition, it is necessary to approach data collection gradually in order to avoid overwhelming network operators with too much information at once. Ultimately, achieving environmental goals will require both reducing digital technology consumption and increasing energy efficiency across all forms of digital media. One way that digital technology consumption can be reduced is by encouraging companies to adopt more sustainable business practices. For example, reducing energy use during operation or transitioning towards more environmentally-friendly materials when manufacturing products. Another way to reduce energy consumption is through improving communication between different parts of the digital ecosystem. Telecommunications operators are important information resources that can help us better understand the environmental impact of digital technologies. By collecting data on energy consumption, emissions, and lifecycle behavior of electronic equipment, technicians may be able to make informed decisions about how best to support these industries. The text discusses the importance of collecting this information starting in 2021 and 2024, with a goal of having it ready by January 2021 and January 2024. The text discusses the importance of data collection in order to understand how users interact with digital devices and content, as well as the environmental impact of data centers. It provides examples of data that could be collected, including information on emissions from various types of products, levels of recycling, and use of electronic devices. The text also discusses the role that suppliers of content (such as online platforms or app developers) may play in reducing waste and promoting sustainable consumption habits. Finally, it suggests ways in which data collection at this level might be carried out initially, with a focus on emissions from products manufactured by major providers of content. Data centers are often full of servers that are "comatose," meaning they're physically active but don't contribute anything to the network or consume any resources. This is a growing problem, as it means that more capital is being wasted on inactive servers. There are several indicators that can be used to measure this problem, and researchers are currently working to make these data public so that decision-makers can better understand the state of enterprise data centers. The text discusses the need for environmental indicators to be developed in order to improve the sustainability of information technology (IT) products and services. It goes on to discuss how emissions from different types of IT products and services can be measured, as well as the various impacts these emissions have on the environment. Finally, it provides examples of environmental indicators that could be used to measure the sustainability of IT products and services.

The main points that summarize all above text while maintaining all relevant information from it would include: 

1) Data centers are often full of servers that are "comatose," meaning they're physically active but don't contribute anything to the network or consume any resources; this is a growing problem because it means more capital is being wasted on inactive servers. 
2) There are several indicators that can be used to measure this problem, and researchers are currently working to make these data public so decision-makers can better understand the state of enterprise data centers. 
3) Environmental indicators could help improve sustainability by measuring emissions from different types of IT products and services. 
4) Examples of environmental indicators include energy efficiency and environmental impact measurements. 
5) Integration into network design and operation is important in order to reduce energy consumption on 4G/5G networks; taking environmental factors into account when designing and operating them includes evaluating technologies based on their absolute energy consumption rather than just comparing them based on their relative performance . Furthermore, optical fiber transmission over cellular radio frequencies should replace mobile broadband technologies based on cellular radio frequencies due not only its This text discusses different telecommunications technologies and their respective performance characteristics. Older technologies tend to be less energy efficient, but they are more likely to be substitutable between different technologies. The Arcep has called for greater awareness of fiber-optic networks and their potential advantages over traditional copper networks in order to facilitate the transition to this more energy-efficient technology. Fiber networks are also subject to obsolescence, so it is important that operators manage them accordingly in order to preserve their usefulness. The transition towards fiber should ultimately result in a lower environmental impact for connected devices. The text discusses the importance of infrastructure in relation to the environment, and highlights the role that civil engineering plays in this regard. It explains how outdated technology used for mobile phone networks can have a negative impact on the environment, and points out that if 2G and 3G networks were to be discontinued soon, it would require a significant amount of resources to replace them. This would put an enormous burden on network operators and could lead to the gradual attrition of mobile phone capabilities over time. If this situation were to arise, it would require careful planning in order to ensure that replacement technologies are available when needed.

The text discusses the potential for networks to replace several hundred thousand ball bearings. Older technologies (2G million terminals, which would have a significant environmental impact) cannot meet the cost-effective needs of high-speed networks, but they are better understood than newer technologies (4G and 5G). However, these new technologies are more energy efficient, providing a reduction in environmental impact over time. It is still unclear which network development path will be followed: extinction of older technologies or continued use of legacy networks with reduced capacity. Two other ideas to consider are: first, that residual traffic on 2G and 3G markets remains significant; and second, that foreign examples show a reallocation of resources freed up by discontinuing older technology deployments. Both concepts require prior conditions to be met - such as widespread migration to newer networks - before they can take hold.

Recent studies have shown that 2G and 3G networks still serve the best in terms of connectivity within buildings and rural areas, even though 4GLTE has been largely replaced by LTE Advanced since its inception in 2012 . However , there is concern about whether or not good engineering practice will continue to be upheld when constructing telecommunications infrastructure near protected sites or important infrastructure assets . In order address these concerns , France Stratégie proposes working with telecom providers as well as individual engineers during group discussions aimed at determining best practices for constructing telecommunications networks . Finally , The text discusses the importance of infrastructure and how it can impact both the environment and business operations. It explains that extinction of certain communication technologies does not necessarily change consumer behavior, as many "consumers" now use multiple technologies. The text also discusses how environmental impacts can be reduced by optimizing network usage and using intelligent technologies to manage networks more effectively. Regulatory authorities have at their disposal a number of tools to help reduce environmental impact in the meantime. Infrastructure is important for both environmental and business reasons, and there are many ways to reduce environmental impacts associated with network usage. Future trends in infrastructure development could have significant implications for both environmental and business concerns, including the need for better planning when designing networks, as well as strategies for reducing electronic waste. The text discusses the various ways in which technology can be harmful to users, and how these harms can be mitigated. It covers topics such as obsolescence culture, the impact of technology on the environment, and user experience. One key issue that is discussed is the fact that many devices are designed to become obsolete much more quickly than they should, leading to increased environmental waste and decreased user satisfaction. In order to address these issues, it is suggested that manufacturers be given a legal right to repair broken devices. Additionally, policies aimed at limiting software obsolescence should be implemented in order to ensure that devices last longer. Finally, it is stressed that user experience must be taken into account when designing new technologies; if this isn't done, users will eventually grow tired of using outdated or malfunctioning products.

The European Union is working to establish a "right to full repair." If the owner of a digital terminal is very attached to a specific service, such as photo editing or messaging, they may not be able to access other services (such as battery life or sustainability information) that could be reasons enough for them to switch terminals. In order to improve the accessibility and awareness of sustainability issues, manufacturers may implement methods such as designing products with durability in mind from the start. These measures would also include reducing environmental impact by avoiding sources of heat buildup and using standardized components in devices that are controlled by operating systems. Acting on mature OSes is critical for ensuring durable digital terminals overall. The text discusses the importance of taking environmental into account when designing and updating software applications. It notes that there are a limited number of actors who are already responsible for this task, and that it is important develop ways t o better understand these actors’ practices in order t o improve th e sustainability offi cial s p roducts . O ne possible way t o achieve this goal would b e t o encourage existing software producers toprofile standards-based eco-design practices , wh ich woul d help The text discusses the various issues and challenges that are associated with the current state of mobile operating systems. It highlights the importance of developing more effective OSes that can be tailored to each individual device, while also ensuring that these systems are able to throttle and control usage in order to prolong device life. Overall, this is an important issue because it underscores the need for mobile devices to be recycled in a responsible way if they are going to have any hope of lasting beyond two or three years. The text discusses the issue of metal recycling and how it is not nearly as effective as it could be. Many high-tech functions rely on small metals, and this has led to a growing trend of promotional offers for users to recycle their devices. However, this practice has had a limited effect due to the low uptake rate among consumers and distributors. Meanwhile, environmental initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of electronic waste are also having an impact, with more people beginning to see recycling as a viable option for their old electronics. The main concern here is that these measures may reduce consumer confidence in recycled products, which could have a negative impact on future sales. In addition to encouraging changes in consumer behavior, the authority might also take steps to improve knowledge about recycling practices among end users and manufacturers alike. This would help ensure that recycled products are durable and easy to repair without requiring regular maintenance or software updates

The text discusses several ways to reduce the incentive for users to renew their subscriptions to broadband services. One approach is make it easier for new, innovative models of broadband distribution t emerge . Another is encourage more responsible practices by service providers when using bandwidth-intensive applications such as websites video streaming services cloud storage . Finally , it is important t ensure th d devices ar designed "by design" with a sustainable digital footprint in mind Facebook is one of the most important CDN providers in terms of traffic volume, and this has led to increased congestion on networks across the globe. France is not alone in this trend; more than half of all internet traffic entering France comes from four major CDN providers: Netflix, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. This concentration has led to network congestion becoming increasingly widespread throughout Europe.

Some providers of internet services are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to reduce the environmental impact of their users’ online activities without compromising user experience. However, given that they do not control content distribution or customer behavior, it seems likely that even if individual sites were to make significant efforts towards reducing their environmental impact, collective action would still be necessary in order to propagate those practices across millions of websites created each year. When it comes to the main services that should consider implementing tools to encourage more sustainable use of bandwidth, several causes have been cited: incentives aimed at the largest bandwidth consumers (such as a tax or tariff), measures designed to reduce the overall impact of large data flows on smaller actors (such as limiting consumption levels for those who consume a lot of data), and good practices such as using storage and equipment located locally. One proposal that is frequently mentioned is the imposition of a tax or tariff on those who generate the most data – in effect, targeting those with the greatest online footprint. However, implementation will likely be difficult given that many large companies rely heavily on bandwidth usage for their business operations. The text discusses the various ways in which internet usage can have an impact on the environment, and provides recommendations for mitigating those impacts. One way to reduce environmental impact is through free cooling of data centers using evaporative cooling systems. This system uses air from outside the building to cool servers when it becomes too hot inside the building. The text also discusses other ways in which internet usage can have an impact, including energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of how internet usage can affect both the environment and individual users. The text discusses the importance of taking action to protect the environment and ensure public trust in technology. It discusses how data collection and analysis can help improve environmental awareness and make informed decisions about how to use technology. The text also points out that, beyond simply collecting data, it is also important to use this information in a way that encourages users to make responsible choices for their own well-being. This requires strategies such as providing clear and concise information about environmental impacts associated with digital technologies, ensuring legal safeguards are in place to protect user privacy, and working towards increased interoperability between different digital tools and services. The government could consider implementing a proactive approach to data governance, specifically focusing on the development of tools that would help consumers make informed decisions about their environmental impact. Several positive initiatives that are already available or could be enhanced with the deployment of existing tools are mentioned, such as "Openfoodfacts" and "Yuka." The government may also consider launching projects aimed at developing quality comparison tools and public awareness campaigns on environmental matters. If action is not taken, other tools may emerge to help regulate data by means of information. The text discusses a number of topics related to the environment, including initiatives taken by the ADEME with regards to creating a reference guide for environmental measurement. One main point made is that it is important to measure environmental issues in order to better understand them and provide information that can be used by users. Another key point made is that environmental impact should be considered when designing policies and incentives for telecommunications providers. Finally, the text discusses ways in which environmental impacts can be minimized in mobile networks.

The text provides an overview of how digital technology has had a significant impact on society, both positively and negatively. It discusses how policymakers have developed codes of conduct for both users and providers of digital content, but these codes are often ineffective due to a lack of enforcement mechanisms. To address this issue, policymakers are increasingly turning to measures that promote “regulation by data” – such as developing tools that help consumers make informed decisions about their consumption choices and their impact on the environment. One such measure is publishing an “environmental barometer” that would track the best practices across all aspects of the digital ecosystem. Another proposal is “regulation by data” – which would involve imposing tariffs on those who abuse bandwidth or use excessive amounts of energy when online. While these proposals deserve further analysis, they illustrate just how important it is for policymakers to develop innovative strategies in order to sustainably manage our growing reliance on technology. The digital transformation of the internet is a process that involves improving the efficiency and sustainability of internet services. Arcep, a French organization, has released a report on fiber optic networks and scientists have developed metrics for assessing the sustainability of data centers. European Union lawmakers have passed a resolution calling for a single market for digital services that is more environmentally friendly. Edge computing refers to using smaller, more localized data centers instead of centralized "big" ones. Cloud RANs are an architecture for a centralized radio network accessed through virtualization technology and cloud computing platforms which can be deployed at large scale and collaboratively. Ecoconception is the concept of integrating environmental aspects into product design and development. The text discusses the environmental impact of digital products and services. It covers emissions from both domestic and international sources, as well as the impact of digital technologies on the environment in general. The main points covered include: -The environmental impact of digital products and services is significant, covering emissions from both domestic and international sources. -Digital technologies have a negative impact on the environment, particularly when it comes to climate change. Digital technology is having a significant impact on the environment, with internet-connected objects (IoT) producing more CO2 than traditional businesses. One way to measure an object's energy efficiency is by its power usage effectiveness (PUE), and access networks are essential for connecting people and devices to each other. In addition, cyber security risks and environmental impacts related thereto are being discussed in detail at various events this year. This workshop aimed to explore the connections between cybersecurity and environment, for the first time. The first session focused on offering a common understanding of risk, while the second session explored potential synergies between cybersecurity and environmental efforts. Participants were then asked to identify challenges facing both public and private sectors in achieving cyber resilience by 2025. Finally, each group was asked to come up with concrete solutions to address these challenges.

The main points that emerged from this workshop include:
-Both cybersecurity and environmental concerns share many commonalities, making cooperation between these two domains possible; 
-There is growing interest among stakeholders in pursuing cyber resilience through innovative systems design and data management strategies; 
-Stakeholders must work together to develop solutions that are effective across multiple dimensions (political, economic, social). The text discusses the importance of cybersecurity and digital trust in the present day, and identifies three key challenges that must be addressed if society is to maintain its digital infrastructure: risk management, sustainable development, and convincing decision-makers that a lack of effort on the part of government officials towards cyberspace security will have long-term consequences. In addition to these overarching concerns, specific risks associated with cyberattacks were also discussed, including environmental damage caused by data breaches and economic impacts stemming from lost business due to online attacks. The workshop participants were then asked to project what 2025 might look like for cybersecurity and digital trust, based on current trends and predictions. This exercise yielded three main scenarios: one in which cyberthreats become increasingly widespread; another in which critical ecosystem balances are threatened by technology advances; and a third in which society is unable to adequately respond to major cyberincidents. The participants were then divided into groups tasked with coming up with concepts or principles that could help guide future action on cybersecurity issues. Some of these concepts included risk assessment, cross-sector collaboration, education for all stakeholders, effective response strategies when crises do occur as well as public awareness campaigns designed to build public confidence in online systems. Overall this event Cybersecurity and environmentalism are two important fields that can work together to protect digital infrastructure and ecosystems. However, efforts to share data accurately across different purposes can be difficult, and transitioning to a digital economy that is sustainable is an overarching goal. To have lasting impact, cybersecurity measures must be aligned with these broader goals. Additionally, synergies between cybersecurity and environmental efforts are important in order to create viable solutions. While this may seem like an ambitious goal at first glance, it is worth considering if we are truly committed to preserving our digital infrastructure for future generations.
