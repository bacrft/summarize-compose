In 2019, the percentage of smartphones in French households surpassed the percentage of computers. This increase in digital usage has led to uncontrolled growth in our use and impacts of technologies, with 44% of French citizens believing that the digital world is a threat to the environment. In reality, electronic devices are responsible for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The impact on local environments is even more pronounced as Nantes' economy has largely transitioned to a tertiary sector, with an increasing number of jobs in information technology over the past few years. To make matters worse, we are currently experiencing a health crisis caused by widespread use of digital technologies: sudden intensification of work-from-home, explosion in online orders, and rapid deployment of 5G. Digital technologies present an opportunity to reduce our environmental footprint relative to traditional workplace travel or paperless document management. However, this opportunity is only beginning to be realized at local levels; much more needs to be done before we can say that electronic devices have had a significant negative impact on climate change globally or locally within France. In order to assess the environmental impact of different digital solutions more systematically and compare them against previous solutions options, it is important that policymakers understand how these technologies affect local ecosystems and public services. This summary explores factors contributing to electronic device's global environmental impact as well as identifying policy levers for actors involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from territorial development The digital world is having a significant impact on the environment, with data centers and smartphones being two of the main sources of pollution. The report “Le numérique, l’angle mort des politiques environnementales et climatiques” released in June 2020 highlights the importance of taking action to address this issue. Energy consumption related to digital activities is responsible for 50% of greenhouse gas emissions, which are largely localized to Asia where phones are manufactured from rare metals that end up as waste after only 23 months. Meanwhile, energy consumption related to web browsing accounts for 19% of all emissions. To ensure an even distribution of energy use throughout the day, we need to find ways to reduce our reliance on traditional forms of energy production. The text discusses the various ways in which digital technology impacts the environment, and highlights the importance of reducing our reliance on digital technologies. It points out that, while digital technology has a small impact on overall emissions levels, it is nonetheless responsible for increasing pollution levels in some cases. The text offers advice on how we can reduce our environmental impact from digital technologies, and provides examples of initiatives that are already underway. Overall, the text emphasizes the need to take measures to reduce our reliance on digital technologies while also continuing to develop innovative and more energy-efficient technologies. The digital age is rapidly changing the way we live and work, and it is also responsible for increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. By 2025, 8% of all emissions related to the digital world will come from this technology. This number is growing quickly, and without more sustainable practices in place, energy consumption will continue to outpace renewable energy sources. However, advances in energy efficiency technologies could help offset some of these issues. Meanwhile, efforts to reduce carbon footprints through digital innovation are necessary if we hope to keep our planet healthy. Smart technologies are not effective solutions to climate change and energy issues, according to a new report from environmental advocates. In fact, these innovations could actually make the problem worse. Despite techno-solutionist rhetoric, these technologies will have little impact on solving the problems they purport to address. Instead, they will cause more harm than good. Municipalities are key players in digital society and responsible for public policies that rely on digital tools and massive data sets to design, regulate or offer new services to the population. In Loire-Atlantique department in France, for example, policymakers decided to equip only disadvantaged students due to budgetary constraints and environmental concerns related to data storage capacity. The challenge of obesity in digital age As physical infrastructure undergoes rapid transformation as a result of widespread adoption of digital services, agencies face an increasing demand for storage space that is growing exponentially along with the number of "big data" applications being deployed. This has led departments such as the Department of Loire-Atlantique in France to invest heavily in green technology initiatives such as using recycled plastics in equipment procurement instead of purchasing products made with environmentally harmful materials like lead or mercury. Managing information overload within public services As physical infrastructure becomes increasingly digitized and reliant on automated systems, agencies must grapple with how best to protect personal privacy while still providing access to government services for those who need them most. To date, consideration of environmental impacts when acquiring information technology (IT) assets has been limited by budgetary constraints and shortsightedness rather than deliberate planning based on sound principles The text discusses the growing trend of local data storage, and how this has created tension between the need to keep sensitive information safe and the increasing demand for such data. In 2021, the Department of Health will hold a day dedicated to cleaning up digital data. This is in addition to other initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of digital data that needs to be stored in the first place. The threefold strategy of "Avoiding, compensating, and reducing" is likely to become increasingly important when it comes to projects related to digital technology in the near future. Awareness among citizens about the impact of their online activities is important if we are hope- ful of achieving a sustainable level of digital wastefulness. It is up to us as individuals - especially those who are most impacted by technology -to take action and educate ourselves on its consequences. At present, legislation obligates internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile operators alike to report their carbon footprints annually from January 2020 onwards. In 2022, one in five French people owns devices that are not functional or sleeping, and they keep them mainly because of the lack of practical access or knowledge about recycling processes. A local cycle-of-life strategy for digital equipment at the territorial level may involve a schematic plan for device volume, frequency of replacement, and existence of recycling networks. Local organizations developing these networks fall within the scope of municipal actions aimed at reducing environmental impact from digital technology. However, while these actors are increasingly taking proactive measures to reduce their environmental impact, they continue to create new uses and are seen as responsible for energy consumption beyond what is necessary. 

In 2019, 41% of respondents said that mitigating the environmental impacts caused by digital technology was an urgent issue due to increasing usage levels. Meanwhile, 31% argued that it was an issue due to growing energy demands associated with increased use of digital technologies. Municipalities have a role to play in supporting sustainable economic development through initiatives such as improving energy efficiency or promoting renewable energy production. The text discusses the various environmental impacts that can be caused by digital technologies, and highlights the importance of taking these impacts into account when designing and implementing such technologies. It recommends that local governments adopt a systematic approach to assessing the environmental impact of digital projects, and outlines a method for doing so. However, much work still needs to be done in this area, as evidenced by the lack of an effective methodology for assessing the energy efficiency of digital projects. Finally, the text urges local governments to take into account both economic and environmental factors when making decisions about using digital technologies. The text discusses the importance of environmental assessment, and how it can be used to test new solutions in the field of each public policy. On the territory of Nantes Metropolitan Area, the Nantes City Lab initiative offers project holders the opportunity to experiment with their large-scale natural solutions in the city. A more systematic evaluation of projects would allow judging the potential benefits and environmental impacts of tested solutions. Technological choices will determine our future means of action The use of technologies may create dependency situations and reduce local government's ability to make decisions, especially when it comes to energy transition. Municipal authorities through its many delegated entities, providers, or users are involved in a wide range of everyday life activities: transportation, housing, education or urban planning. They have experience in managing construction projects and are guarantors for public interest and common good. Therefore municipal authorities should continue relying on fundamental knowledge: setting objectives, delegating responsibilities and assessing territorial action against key issues related to digital transformation such as climate change mitigation. 

20 years ago there were strategies designed specifically for abandoned motor vehicles (those not driven anymore). Why not build tomorrow plans dedicated to unmanaged digital terminals? With unstoppable increase in environmental concern, municipalities might be forced to develop plans specific for managing digital terminal impacts: circular economy strategy for urban planning design around data centers or deployment plan for using digital tools within public policies Today, the focus is on educating users about the potential impacts of digital usage, but what will tomorrow bring? Over one-seventh of all French citizens are unfamiliar with the internet and feel at a disadvantage when using it. This is also true for future digital users who may be more likely to trust and use technology if they are made aware of its benefits. So far, education has been the only effective tool in mitigating these effects. In 2021, 78% of respondents say they would be willing to pay extra for devices that use less electricity or that can be recycled easily. These are just a few examples of how people are already adapting their behavior in response to constantly evolving technology. Is education alone enough to keep up with this trend? The growing impact of digital technologies on our environment raises questions about whether or not awareness alone will be sufficient to manage them effectively. The text discusses the importance of reducing the impact of digital technologies on the environment, and provides a number of recommendations for doing so. Among these are developing a detailed understanding of where digital technologies are being used and how they're impacting the environment, mapping out locations where energy resources are being consumed, assessing the environmental impacts of different digital technologies in comparison to current practices, and educating users about their environmental responsibilities. In addition, it is important to consider ways to reduce or offset the environmental impact of digital technologies when possible.
