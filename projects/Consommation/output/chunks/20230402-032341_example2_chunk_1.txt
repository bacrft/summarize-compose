In 2019, for the first time in France, smartphones surpassed computer ownership rates. 
- As a result, uncontrolled growth of digital usage has led to environmental impacts that are becoming increasingly apparent- 44% of French people consider the internet as a threat to the environment. 
- In practice, digital usage is responsible for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
- The increase in smartphone use has left us with no choice but to confront this environmental impact head on- especially when it comes to health concerns caused by sudden work intensification and online shopping exploding. 
- This issue is only starting to be addressed in territorial development strategies. Transportation related pollution is still vastly different from that generated by digital usage. 
- The opportunity offered by digital technology to reduce our environmental footprint relative to professional travel or document paperlessness must be weighed against its benefits and costs. The document discusses the production of electronic equipment, with a focus on smartphones and other digital devices, and electric energy consumption.
-The impact of digital consumption is also considered based on the type of energy production (nuclear, coal, hydroelectric…).
-This information leads to estimates for electricity consumption in all places where our online activities take place.
-The document discusses ways to balance electricity production and consumption, noting the different impacts on the environment depending on the time of day.
-Technological and temporal aspects of electricity production lead to differences in carbon emissions for digital uses.
-Reducing local impact of digital uses would consist of relocating various events occurring naturally at an international scale. 
-VOD video demand (i.e., watching videos when requested) is an excellent example of an event with high energy consumption but geographically dispersed across the globe. 
-While 36% of French adults over 12 years old are subscribed to a video service in France in 20194, how can we reduce consumption? The increased efficiency of energy usage leads to an increase in previous generation's pollution. 
-By 2040, 8% of French emissions will come from digital activities. 
-The uncontrolled growth in consumption is leading to environmental impacts not being taken into account when acquiring equipment. 
-Only disadvantaged high school students will be equipped with tablets to limit student dropout rates under the department's current plan. The document discusses the role of local governments in the digital age, and how they can help to sensitize citizens and professionals about the impact of their digital usage.
- In order to keep sensitive data locally, tension is often created between local government's need for data storage and citizens' desire for access to that data.
- A triptyque called "Éviter, compenser, réduire" may be imposed on digital projects in order to mitigate these tensions. The document discusses ways in which digital actors can be more environmentally responsible.
-Some of the actors involved in the digital sphere are asked to compensate for the negative impacts they create.
-The document also mentions that local governments have a role to play in this area by providing assistance with energy efficiency, sharing resources, or making smarter city planning decisions.
-A majority of participants (61%) think that a municipality taking proactive measures to reduce environmental impacts would be a good thing. Environmental evaluation of digital projects is central to the Senate's information commission's report released in June 2020.
-A dedicated methodology for "smart" projects is the only recommendation singled out clearly by the Senate's information commission in their report released in June 2020.
-The Shift Project, a think tank, published a publication in October 2020 proposing a method for analyzing the energy relevance of digital projects on territorial grounds.
-Everything still needs to be done here: comparative analysis of alternative solutions, definition of environmental indicators or even life cycle assessment. The document discusses the importance of digital tools in local public policy.
-Local governments are not currently using these tools effectively to address pressing issues like poverty.
-Sensibility is an important tool for addressing this issue, but it may not be enough.
-Education and training are necessary to help people understand how digital devices work and how they can use them responsibly. It is important to have data on electronic energy consumption in order to understand the implications of online uses. 
-Data on electronic energy consumption does not currently include issues related to online usage. To what extent can territorially based initiatives take back control over desirable online uses? The first step in achieving this goal is understanding where we start. 
-A diagnosis is necessary before setting an ambition. The availability of local information on digital device usage is essential. However, current data on energy consumption does not reflect the scale of our electronic usage. What kind of information should be made available at territorial level in order to achieve an understanding of the impacts of digital devices? 
-The document discusses how to produce a cartography of places where electronic waste is stored and mobilized resources, as well as estimating the volume of electronic equipment and terminals in residents' homes and businesses. 
-At a more operational level, the first lever for municipalities concerned with managing electronic equipment and usage is internal structures and networks dedicated to this purpose. There are such structures and networks available, for example ADN Ouest. In the short term, immediate urgency is needed for: (1) developing territorial strategies specifically designed to manage our digital media usage (local data center clusters, recycling networks...), (2) finding a place in the agenda of environmental impacts of our digital media The document discusses how data centers can be used to help reduce energy consumption.
