The increase in electronic equipment and devices is fueling concerns about energy consumption.
-There are still many questions about how the digital revolution will impact energy consumption.
-It's important to consider the environmental impacts of the digital age, as well as other consumer behaviors influenced by technology.
-"Green" promises for a more sustainable digital era are still unproven.
-We need to take into account all of the other pressures technology imposes on the environment, especially when we're talking about electronics recycling. "Une cartographie répertoriait 156 data centers en France en 20166."
- "On ne connaît pas dans le détail le nombre et le type d’appareils qu’ils abritent, mais une étude prospective a estimé leur consommation électrique à environ 6 TWh/an en 2015 : la moitié pour les appareils, l’autre pour les périphériques et la climatisation7."
- "RTE table lui sur une consommation deux fois moindre5." Devices that use a lot of energy, such as smartphones, are called "energy gray."
- European efficiency regulations call for 5% to 50% of the device's operating energy consumption to be accounted for in inventories.
- The cumulative amount of energy gray in an area can represent up to 20% of total power usage.
- Carbon accounting calculations may give a more accurate estimate of the weight of energy gray in an area. The impact of the manufacturing process on environmentalism is becoming increasingly important as more efficient and mobile devices are created.
-This justifies giving it all the attention necessary, and making greater efforts than today to make electronic devices more durable, repairable, reusable, and recyclable. This document discusses the progress that is being made, and it even intensifies with stricter regulations at European levels.
-The need for climate control in data centers will also be reduced thanks to better design of facilities and the reuse of heat generated by nearby buildings.
-How far are these advances possible? For example, Greentouch, a consortium of professionals who have worked on future digital networks, has announced potentials that are quite spectacular: it is possible to reduce electricity consumption by 98% in ten years. The document discusses the potential for energy savings of 40% or more with par an.
-The average computer is expected to use 3% more annually and tablets are expected to use 7% more annually on average.
-The number of monitors for computers is decreasing while the number of laptop screens will decrease over time. The document predicts that there will be an increase in electric power consumption from digital devices by 25% in 2030, or 3% of the national current electricity consumption. 
-This prediction is consistent with RTE's projection of a very modest increase in energy consumption from technologies related to information and communication over the next five years. The digital revolution is likely to bring an energy demand increase in other sectors. 
-The digital has infiltrated all economic sectors and theoretically has the ability to sustain wasteful energy consumption behaviors like promoting more sustainable consumption behaviors. 
-It is clear that so far, transportation sector growth is mainly supported by digital technologies (like the ability to have anything delivered from anywhere else in the world with a click of a button). 
-The digital industry often points to its supposed ability to save energy in a systemic way. However, studies and prospectives on this topic are usually theoretical, insufficiently systemized4 and unaware of rebound effects24. 
-For example, if one looks at potential changes suggested by a 2009 study commissioned by large companies (representing about 110 TWh/an of cumulative primary energy savings25), it becomes apparent that most of them have not been realized (for example, widespread implementation of urban tolls, massive development of smart homes technology, benefits of video conferencing). It seems risky therefore to assert that occasional benefits observed on pilot or case projects can be generalized across all sectors The digital revolution will undoubtedly bring an important need for electrical equipment in our country, coupled with 
-The progress made in energy efficiency should be able to avoid an explosion in demand for electricity. For this to happen, manufacturers and operators of the electrical sector should systematically use the most economical technologies, and priority should be given to digital uses that promote energy transition. Public policies and regulations should be intensified and updated regularly in order to follow rapidly changing industry trends and the appearance of new equipment.
-Consumers of electronic services have an important role to play too, by avoiding unnecessary data flows (email usage wisely, controlling files sensibly, turning off devices when not needed) The document discusses ways to reduce emissions from technology, including data centers that are more efficient.
-The document also discusses the importance of energy labeling for products, and what consumers want from their technology.
-The document discusses the growth of data centers and how this is impacting the environment.
-The document provides information on ways to reduce energy consumption in data centers.
-There is a section on the impact of IoT technology on the environment.
