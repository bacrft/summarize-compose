The impact of the internet, digital devices, and online activities on the environment is a growing concern that is being addressed by more and more sectors. The Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius requires us to reduce our carbon footprint significantly. However, while the internet has many benefits for society, it may not be able to contribute as much to this goal if we don't take action to limit its environmental impact. According to various studies, the internet currently accounts for 3-4% of national emissions levels. Beyond carbon emissions, other environmental impacts associated with the internet include water consumption and energy use. GreenIT.fr warns that beyond climate change concerns, our overall ecological footprint is also increasing rapidly due to increased consumption in all areas of life fueled by technology advancement (e.g., data storage and processing). The Arcep has decided to take full advantage of its mission in order to address this issue by focusing on reducing our carbon footprint through innovative technologies such as blockchain technology. By doing so, we can help prevent global temperatures from reaching dangerous levels while also preserving our environment for future generations The text discusses the Grenelle de l’environnement, a national environmental policy summit that took place in 201012. The purpose of the summit was to discuss ways to improve environmental sustainability within the government's action in relation to the environment. One result of this summit was the formation of the Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat (CCC), a group of citizens drawn from all walks of life who are tasked with developing measures that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 relative to 1990 levels. The CCC released its report on 21 June 2020 and has since been working on implementing its proposals.

One issue facing policymakers when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is that digital technologies have created an unprecedented level of consumption and wastefulness. According to a recent study, if current trends continue, global emissions from digital activities will exceed those from physical activities by 2040. In order to address this problem, policymakers must take into account not only traditional emission sources (such as manufacturing and energy usage) but also foreign emissions generated through digital activity.

Overall, the text provides an overview of how digital technologies are affecting both our environment and economy, highlighting some potential solutions for mitigating these effects. It is important reading for anyone interested in understanding how technology affects our world and what we can do about it The Autorité de régulation des communications électroniques (Arcep) is a French government agency that is focused on the regulation of digital services and networks. In 2019, the Arcep published a note called "L'emmental du numérique n'est pas forcément preinte carbone du numérique" which suggests that users of digital services and networks are in control of their choices regarding how their technology affects the environment, rather than being bound by technological constraints. This perspective is part of an overall effort by the Arcep to open up its regulatory work to include more stakeholders in order to better respond to changing social and environmental conditions. Eight online meetings were held between July and November 2020 in order to bring together representatives from various sectors involved in digital life, with the goal of developing joint strategies for sustainable development. The text discusses a number of topics related to the concept of digital sustainability. Among these are the importance of networks and communication technologies in today's society, how to create a sustainable online environment, and ways to make networks more equitable. In addition, the text discusses how regulators are working to ensure that communications technologies are sustainable. Finally, it provides a brief overview of two upcoming discussions focused on digital sustainability: one being organized by European regulators, the other being led by the Arcep (the French national regulator for telecommunications and information systems). The text discusses the importance of taking environmental considerations into account when designing and using technology, and provides examples of how this can be done. It also discusses ways in which participants in the technology industry can help to ensure that their products are environmentally friendly. Finally, it outlines some concrete steps that government officials can take to improve monitoring and assessment of technology's impact on the environment. The Arcep wants to ensure that the digital economy does not have a negative environmental impact, and has released 11 proposals in order to achieve this. Among these proposals are measures to encourage the transition from fixed networks to fiber-optic networks, clarify the importance of mobile networks, and develop better understanding of how data centers affect the environment. Additionally, legal obligations must be put in place for businesses to report their efforts to reduce their environmental footprint. Finally, consumers need help making informed choices about reducing their environmental impact by using environmentally-friendly technology. The Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI) predicts that by 2023, the number of devices connected to the internet will have reached 29.3 billion worldwide. This growth is due in part to the increasing use of “internet of things” (IoT) devices, which allow for a multitude of services and content to be accessed through physical objects such as televisions and computers. The majority of French households (approximately 60%) are currently equipped with at least one device connected to the internet, with smartphones accounting for the largest share (approximately 50%). The digital age is progressing rapidly, but there are still many challenges that need to be overcome in order for it to truly take off. One of these challenges is the lack of enough electricity to power all the new devices and services that are being created. According to a study by the International Data Corporation (IDC), by 2020, only 8% of the world's population will be able to access the internet via traditional means such as landlines and TVs. Instead, most people will be using digital devices such as phones and computers. This increase in digital usage has led to an increase in data traffic on networks around the world. In 2017, IP Global transit- ing on mobile networks accounted for 16% of total global traffic, and by 2022 this figure is expected to reach 57%. The growth in video consumption can be attributed in part to this increased data traffic. More people are now connecting to the internet via their mobile phones than ever before, which has led to an increase in content and services available online. In the context of digital marketing, there has been an increase in subscription-based video streaming services, such as VàDA (video à la demande par abonnement), which offer pop-up advertisements. Additionally, the percentage of people who use their phones to watch videos online has increased overall by 11 points in one or more formats, such as video, banners, etc. This trend is also reflected in the growth of data consumption on mobile networks. According to the Arcep Barometer on Digital Economy35, traffic generated by digital content consumed over mobile networks grew by 36% in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase is due to a variety of factors including increased population usage levels and a better definition of videos online.

One consequence of these increasing trends is that data stored on mobile networks has grown eightfold since 2011 and will triple over 2017-2022 according to the Shift Project36. This increase poses significant environmental concerns as it leads to greater accumulation of data at centralized locations rather than being distributed evenly across devices. As data storage becomes increasingly centralized and sensitive, it will become increasingly important for companies and governments to develop strategies for managing this growing mountain of information. The digital world is growing increasingly important as a source of greenhouse gas emissions, with 3-4% of global emissions coming from the internet now and 8% projected to grow annually by 2025. GreenIT.fr has released a list of the top 10 uses and applications of GES that are most relevant to the global community, including water usage (via cooling systems), artificial land creation (related to mining rare earths), and other resource consumption related to electronic devices. At the national level, Citizing has estimated that the digital environment's environmental impact is equivalent to 2% of national emissions. This complex ecosystem requires concerted efforts on the part of providers of online services in order to mitigate its negative effects. The text discusses the various ways in which electronic communications technologies can impact the environment. It notes that, while technology can play a role in reducing emissions, it is not the only factor at play. Other factors, such as the way an individual uses technology and how much energy they consume overall, also need to be considered.

One key point made in the text is that electronic communications technologies are often driven by global trends rather than local needs. This means that even if a particular country adopts environmentally-friendly technology standards, other countries with less stringent standards may still produce more emissions because of their reliance on imported goods and services.

Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of how electronic communications technologies can impact both the environment and human health. It highlights some of the ways in which these technologies can be used to reduce emissions and improve efficiency, while also providing insights into why certain countries tend to produce more environmental pollution than others. The text discusses the various ways in which technology has impacted the environment, and how this trend is only going to continue. It explains that while certain technologies are more environmentally damaging than others, all of them are responsible for releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The text also discusses the different ways in which technology impacts the environment, and provides examples of each type of technology. Finally, it outlines some strategies that can be used to reduce these environmental impacts. The text discusses the importance of centers of data and how they are vital in helping to manage and monitor our digital lives. It goes on to say that, while mobile networks are growing more powerful each year, the energy consumption of data centers remains largely tied to improvements made in network communications technology. According to France Stratégie, by 2030, 70% of the energy consumed by data centers will be attributable to mobile networks rather than traditional wired networks. This shift is likely due in part to the increasing number of devices that rely on wireless connections instead of traditional cables. Despite these positive trends, it is still uncertain whether or not energy consumption will continue to grow at a rapid pace within this sector. The European Commission anticipates an increase of 28% in energy consumption for data centers between now and 2030. In order to combat this trend and ensure that we are using resources efficiently, policymakers need to take action with regards to policies surrounding digital consumption. The digital world is having a significant impact on the environment, with 75% of all resources consumed by the digital sector. To ensure an efficient government and citizenry, it is necessary to better understand the environmental impacts of the digital sector. This is where studies like those mentioned in this article come in handy, as they help policymakers make informed decisions about how to best regulate the industry. The text discusses the various ways in which researchers are trying to measure the environmental impact of the digital world. One method is to look at how much carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced as a result of using digital technologies. A study published in 2018 found that, on average, digital technologies produce 16% of CO2 emissions compared to 81% for traditional physical technologies. Another study published last year estimated that, globally, 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions come from digital technology use. These estimates vary depending on the geographical area being studied and the type of data analysis used. Overall, though, it appears that digital technology is having a significant impact on the environment and policymakers need to develop strategies for mitigating its effects. The text discusses the different hypotheses that can impact the estimates of each other, and how this can lead to inconsistent results. There is a lack of standardized methodology for measuring the impact of digital technology on carbon emissions, which makes it difficult to determine exactly how much energy is being used and consumed in relation to digital usage. Some questions that remain unanswered include: How much more energy does using digital technologies actually require? What are the consequences of this increase beyond just carbon emissions? And what kind of metrics should be used to measure these impacts? Despite these limitations, there are some shared concepts among researchers that need further development in order to make accurate predictions about digital technology's impact on carbon emissions. For example, it is necessary to develop common measurement tools that take into account various factors (such as network size and type, device types, etc.) The text discusses the importance of reducing energy consumption and wastefulness, and points to various ways in which technology can be used to help achieve this goal. One way that technology has been shown to be effective in reducing energy consumption is through the use of mobile devices, which will eventually become more efficient than traditional fixed-line phones. Additionally, the article discusses the need for a unified approach to measuring and evaluating energy impacts, as well as strategies for minimizing rebound effects from technological innovations. While these are all important issues that require attention, they are by no means limited to digital technologies alone. The text discusses the various ways in which energy can be more efficiently used, leading to an increase in the overall consumption of coal. This has led to the widespread adoption of steam-powered machines, which has increased the overall use of coal. One project that is aimed at reducing energy consumption is NegaOctet, which aims to develop a reference model for evaluating environmental impacts associated with digital services based on an analysis of their life cycle (ACV). Another important topic discussed in the text is waste management. The law passed in 2020 called for businesses to reduce their waste and recycle more materials. These are just a few examples of how advancements in technology have led to an increase in coal usage and pollution. In order to ensure that these advances are properly evaluated and implemented, it is necessary to collect comprehensive data about processes and infrastructure as well as estimate the power needed for specific applications. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify which data should be collected and made available, as well as determine if any privacy concerns need to be addressed before collecting such information. All of this will help move forward towards achieving sustainable business practices that minimise environmental impact. Data are essential for understanding and managing environmental impacts, but they are often insufficient or unavailable. Efforts to develop better indicators of environmental impact are already underway, based on consensus-based data sources and hypotheses that can be updated as needed. Such indicators could help individual actors take responsibility for their own actions and assess the magnitude of their environmental footprint. In addition, information systems that track digital activity could provide more granular insights into the dynamics and impacts of online behavior. This would make it easier for decision-makers to identify areas of concern and implement effective measures to reduce emissions from digital services. The digital world is constantly evolving, and as a result, the environmental impact of technology has become an increasingly important topic. While there are many ways to measure this impact, complex models that take into account individual choices are still needed. Coordinated efforts by industry, researchers, and public officials will be necessary in order to limit the negative consequences of this rapidly growing sector. First, a number of international organizations have emerged that represent a variety of private and public sector actors. These groups need to work together to develop common understanding about the implications of online activity on the environment and agree on specific actions to take. Secondly, data from different sources must be compared and analyzed in order to create effective plans for mitigating its effects. Several initiatives aimed at facilitating this process have already been launched. The text discusses the importance of communication and collaboration between experts in the environment, technology, and communication fields in order to create environmentally-friendly products. The study of experience between these various actors is essential for developing measures to mitigate the environmental impacts of electronic communications. In France, the ADEME plays an important role in this process by providing guidelines for sustainable use of information technologies. Recently, the UIT published a set of recommendations on assessing environmental impact (recom- mendation ITU-T L.147074). The ADEME has also collaborated on a research project called NegaOctet aimed at developing general principles for evaluating environmental impact of information technologies. The text discusses the need for authorities to better understand and address the environmental impacts of digital technologies, and outlines various ways in which participants can contribute to a collaborative platform designed to achieve this goal. After consulting public documents, Arcep determined that it was necessary to hear from a variety of voices involved in digital technology and the environment, so it developed bilateral dialogues with experts on the topic. Furthermore, in order to facilitate open discussion and gather more diverse perspectives on issues surrounding sustainability, a forum called "For a Sustainable Digital Future" has been established (see section 2.1). Finally, all participants have been invited to provide feedback on the proposals made thus far. The Arcep has launched a platform called "Soutenable" in order to facilitate dialogues between interested parties regarding the environmental impacts of digital transformations. The goal of this platform is to bring together representatives from various sectors (including businesses, technology providers, and environmental organizations) in order to discuss common challenges and opportunities related to the impact of digital technologies on the environment. In September 2020, sixty-five participants responded to an invitation from the Arcep and discussed key priorities for addressing the environmental implications of digital transformation. Among these topics were adapting commercial practices related to electronic waste management, choosing appropriate network infrastructure for a sustainable internet, and creating more efficient use of resources through targeted content consumption. Finally, in October 2020, an online space was created called "Numeriquesoutenable.arcep.fr" which served as a forum for participants to share their insights and experiences with regard to these issues. The Arcep is currently working on a project called "Soutenable Numérique," which aims to create a dialogue between digital participants that is sustainable and manageable. During the first round of these workshops, which took place in September and October, participants discussed topics such as how to connect digitally for networks without sacrificing sustainability or user freedom. In addition, open source software and data storage solutions were also explored. The second round of workshops will be dedicated to more specific policy questions, and will take place in November. The Arcep has organized workshops to help participants discuss the structure of exchanges. By doing so, they were able to develop a better understanding of how to approach these exchanges and find the best way for each individual. The small group format allowed for more in-depth discussions on specific topics while also allowing for more spontaneity and horizontality among the participants. This external perspective provided a foundation for finding the right balance between technical feasibility and accessibility. Additionally, the ANSSI joined in on these workshops by addressing specific topics that could be integrated into Ouishare's overall discussion framework. Through this collaborative effort, participants were able to build trust and create a smooth dialogue which ultimately led to an atelier focused on risk cyber-security: Risk environment, risk equal footing, no matter your profession. The goal was not only met but exceeded as discussions covered a wide range of subjects with practitioners from various backgrounds who had something valuable to contribute. Overall, these workshops helped participants understand each other better and created a platform where everyone can share their knowledge freely without fear of reprisal or conflict of interest. The text discusses the various implications of asynchronous commercial times for businesses. Specifically, the platform "For a Sustainably Digital World" (numeriquesoutenable.arcep.fr) offered participants the opportunity to share their thoughts on how best to create continuity between different models of marketing and sales. The Arcep found that many participants had strong opinions on how best to approach commercial practices, with some advocating for more restraint while others calling for increased incentives and advertising strategies that align with market values. Overall, the discussion yielded several insights into how businesses can improve their current marketing strategies while also taking into account the impact of rapidly changing technology on customer behavior. Terminals can be an interesting alternative to traditional consumer electronics when the offer does not incent consumers to replace their devices frequently. In the case of smartphones, for example, a frequent replacement of devices (due to obsolescence) has negative environmental consequences. Participants discussed various models of obsolescence and their impacts on the environment in detail. Some recommendations included distinguishing between "cultural" and "real" obsolescence, characterizing "logistical" and "technical" obsolescence, and identifying ways to combat each type of degradation. Participants also offered recommendations on how to manage software updates, design user interfaces that are easy to use across different platforms, and recycle or reuse obsolete technology products. Overall, these discussions highlighted the importance of taking into account all forms of technological obsolescence when designing solutions aimed at mitigating its effects on the environment. The third workshop focused on the topic of obsolescence and how to manage it. Participants discussed the various ways in which technology can become obsolete, as well as the challenges associated with updating and maintaining systems. They also discussed ways to reduce environmental impact from technology use. In addition, participants considered how consumer behavior affects technology obsolescence. Overall, this workshop provided a comprehensive overview of the issues surrounding obsolescence and offered strategies for managing it. In this third and final workshop, participants discussed the potential environmental impacts of various IoT technologies. Some key points that were raised include the fact that wireless networks are more energy-intensive than fixed networks, and that devices using older technology such as 2G and 3G can have a significant impact on the environment. Several strategies for reducing environmental impact were also discussed, including encouraging users to adopt more sustainable practices, implementing automatic power management tools, and restricting data usage in order to reduce network load. Finally, it was noted that manufacturers and system operators should play an important role in promoting environmentally-friendly use of IoT technologies by helping users make informed choices about which network to use. The text discusses the potential consequences of extinction of mobile networks 2G and 3G. It notes that these networks are already obsolete due to the increasing use of 4G networks, which are more energy-efficient. Several practical reasons for keeping 2G and 3G networks alive have been identified, including the fact that they are still widely used, many devices are still incompatible with 4G networks, and certain services (such as video streaming) would be difficult to provide without them. While there is some debate over whether or not mobile networks should be eliminated altogether in favor of more sustainable technologies, it is clear that they have a significant impact on energy consumption and must be taken into account when making decisions about online services and content. The text discusses the environmental impact of digital services and content. Several participants identified the need to include a phase of production for terminals in assessing environmental impacts – which should also exceed only questions related to carbon footprint. They also emphasized the need for an eco-design approach that takes into account user preferences and scenarios. In addition, they noted that certain digital services – such as video streaming or virtual reality – require different levels of constraint depending on their type of content: e-commerce, virtual reality, or social media use, respectively. Finally, several specific proposals were discussed: the design of environmentally friendly default settings for internet browsers and applications; limiting data usage by default; and developing more sustainable online advertising models. Participants agreed that further dialogue between providers of internet access and content providers is necessary in order to develop concrete measures to reduce the environmental impact of digital usage/service In this workshop, participants discussed ways to improve the environmental impact of networks. They noted that while certain technologies (such as small cells or network architecture) can have a significant impact on reducing energy consumption, others (such as mutualization or data sharing) may have a negative effect on other aspects of network performance. In order to make the most effective use of these various tools, it is important to understand the coverage and traffic patterns of individual networks. This knowledge can be used to optimize network performance in specific areas based on need. Finally, the participants discussed how users should expect cooperation between different networking tools to result in a net positive effect for both user and environment. In this workshop, participants discussed the importance of connectivity and quality of service for businesses and consumers. They also explored the various factors that need to be considered when planning for such a network, as well as the pros and cons of different approaches. Finally, they looked at how to integrate these considerations into decision-making processes.

The main points that were discussed include: 
- The importance of reliable and high-quality connectivity for both businesses and consumers 
- The various factors that need to be taken into account when planning for such a network 
- The benefits and drawbacks of different deployment strategies During this large discussion, which takes the form of a communication format, there are many free challenges that participants are first interested in advancing the general interest. In addition to discussing a number of specific topics, the urgency of climate change prompts participants to consider ways to achieve energy efficiency and highlight the environmental impact of digital infrastructure development. How then can these two objectives be reconciled? If this goal is to be achieved, it is necessary to first have a better understanding of how users are using digital technologies and what needs they have for connectivity. After discussing these issues, participants turned their attention to questions related to network deployment (diversity in time and space, technical complexity), which led them to discuss the role that user rights should play when it comes to reducing energy consumption. Finally, given all these uncertainties and pressures from various stakeholders, Participants were asked how economic incentives might help promote more sustainable use of digital technologies while still allowing users some degree of choice in what they access and consume. In doing so, they acknowledged the responsibility borne by technology providers as well as consumers for their own energy consumption habits. As network operators strive between meeting conflicting demands from authorities and citizens alike, balancing responsibilities may prove difficult--a challenge that industry or consumer representatives may need help with resolving. The discussion focused on the importance of taking into account the social and environmental impacts of our everyday choices, with participants noting that "individual responsibility should not be substituted for that of the state" when it comes to matters such as smartphone purchases or video streaming. However, this assertion was tempered by comments noting that new technologies require a collective effort before any real progress can be made in terms of understanding or addressing user concerns. Some discussions centered on the need for clear social and environmental standards governing what constitutes a quality product or service, while others raised concerns about government overreach if it attempts to micromanage every aspect of users' lives. Still other participants advocated for more direct action aimed at reducing environmental impact and carbon emissions from our everyday activities. Though these are just starting points, the discussion provides food for thought as we continue to grapple with how technology affects society both positively and negatively. The workshop allowed for the identification of several similarities between the two domains, though they present different contexts. First, concepts and characteristics shared include notions of risk, crisis, ecosystems to protect, and resilience of these systems. The environment and cybersecurity also share many common challenges such as the development of a "sustainable" digital world, and the need to convince decision-makers that an absence of organized cyber security efforts could one day threaten their business activity or economic model. The goal of this collaborative workshop was to explore the links between cybersecurity and environmental issues in relation to identifying several categories of relevant topics: technology-related risks associated with environmental impacts; synergies between environmental experts and cyber security specialists; and potential impacts on energy consumption related to both cyber security activities and crises affecting the environment. In addition, it is necessary to consider how environmental crises may impact cyber risks in turn, with a focus on assessing which technological advantages Cybersecurity possesses over other areas in terms of its ability improve safety while also promoting trust? What specific aspects about cybersecurity should be examined when evaluating its impact on environment? Is there any overlap between environmental concerns and cyber security goals that warrant further exploration? And finally - given that both energy consumption and climate change are major global issues - what synergies might exist between experts from each field who are dedicated to improving efficiency across all dimensions The text discusses the various ways in which cyberattacks can have negative impacts on both physical security and the environment. The authors suggest that policymakers take into account these impacts when developing policies related to cybersecurity and the environment, and that they work together to develop more sustainable models for digital economies. Several actionable recommendations are also offered, including promoting risk-based approaches to cybersecurity, increasing public awareness of environmental implications of cyberattacks, and fostering collaborations between government agencies responsible for cybersecurity and environmental protection. The text discusses the importance of energy efficiency in digital services and how it can be achieved through various means. The main points covered include: 
- Energy efficiency is an important issue that needs to be addressed when developing digital services, as it can have a negative impact on both the environment and users' wallets. 
- There are many ways to achieve energy efficiency in digital services, including using green technology and designing with sustainability in mind. 
- Efforts need to be made to encourage users to adopt more efficient habits, as well as recycle or reuse materials whenever possible. The text discusses the concept of eco-conception, or designing services and products with an environmental focus. It explains that this is a necessary step in transitioning our country to a low-carbon model, and that digital technologies are integral to this process. The article stresses the importance of implementing eco-design practices throughout the product life cycle, from conception to development and beyond. This will help reduce the amount of resources used in relation to services rendered, as well as create jobs that are not easily outsourced or relocated. In addition, it will increase consumer power overall. ADEME is working on various projects related to eco-conception and environmental impact assessment; these include studies on how long products should be used (in order to reduce resource consumption), research into repairing/upgrading devices sustainably, and more. Overall, ADEME believes that both transitions – digitalization and ecological – need to be synergized in order to achieve lasting benefits for society as a whole. The text discusses the importance of understanding the impacts of digital technologies on both the environment and society. Three main axes underlie this discussion: knowledge, behavior, and impact. To reduce environmental impacts, it is necessary to understand both the products that are produced and the users who use them. It is also important to educate consumers about responsible usage of technology, but there is still much that needs to be clarified and shared in terms of specific details and methods. Environmental evaluation requires an analysis of the entire product life cycle as well as consumer behavior. The goal is to progressively disconnect economic growth from resource consumption by means of a more efficient consumption and usage of resources through eco-designing technology infrastructure, recycling processes, and extended product lifespans. The second major axis under consideration is transitioning our country decisively into a circular economy with the objective of decoupling economic growth from resource consumption over time. This law establishes France as a leader in this transition by mandating that all new products must have a circular component by 2025. Finally, digital technologies play an important role in all three axes mentioned above by facilitating communication between people and businesses; providing access to data; accelerating calculations; facilitating eco-design; reducing waste; etcetera. Overall, digital technologies are essential for achieving sustainable development goals while also creating opportunities for increased efficiency across all aspects of our economy We call on people to work effectively with its potential as a lever of environmental transition through its impact on development of skills and training, given its environmental footprint. The 2020 year is especially important for the sector of product repair (as more initiatives are taking place on the topic due to greater global connectivity among products. Arcep-organized workshops have thus been designed to be more complex) or in the area of eco-designing services. This is an opportunity well worth taking advantage of, as it will allow us to exchange views with all stakeholders involved in digital technology. It is also essential that parties involved in digital technology use reliable and verifiable tools in order to sensitize users early on about their responsibilities and enable them make informed choices about their online behavior. In addition, establishing objective criteria for measuring the environmental impact of digital technologies would encourage all actors involved in this field – from start-ups to large corporations –to improve their practices as much as possible. Finally, a sustainable digital economy cannot be achieved without effective measures being taken at every stage of the value chain, based on sound market analysis and controlled innovation. All these tools must be supported by a real understanding of market dynamics and regulatory frameworks so that dynamic and innovative solutions can thrive throughout the entire value chain The European Union is changing its economic model in order to be more transparent and fair for businesses and to promote efficiency within the single market. Different approaches will be necessary depending on the type of products and market (B2B, B2C). French law passed in 2020, which aims to reduce waste and improve environmentalism, is an important step in this process. The EU's new consumer agenda, released in 2021, will also have legal implications. It is important to take into account existing legislation when developing strategies to reduce carbon footprints. For example, calculating emissions using ACV data would help identify specific areas where reductions are needed most. Overall, making ACV data available for public consumption would provide a more accurate picture of corporate carbon footprints. We have a number of historical groups speaking on behalf of the public, which makes it difficult to collect data that is finer and more specific to the needs of businesses in the digital age: growth, which can together push all of the ecosystem's 1h streaming in HD? Between 18 and 400 gCO2eq more transparency. According to studies and countries... With carbon transparency, consumers and businesses 1h on social media? First we need to know can, each at their level, contribute to reducing the environmental footprint what networks, on what device, and with what degree of intensity? With the law for circular economy (AGEC), telecommunications providers must inform their customers' carbon impact of their uses by January 2022. This is an important measure that goes in the right direction, and we are proposing two measures that will make it effective: 

1) Making public all of the assumptions and details about product lifecycle analysis (ACV) for digital products and services. The current regulation allows companies to report a “gross” figure such as “an iPhone 12 Pro 128Gb represents 75 kgCO2eq for its manufacture”. To understand and act on the impact of technology, it is essential that this entire calculation result be made public with assumptions about logistics, consumption during use phases and disposal methods for digital products. This publication should ideally be done via APIs so that tools are available exploiting these data. 

Altitude Group thanks The Group Altitude is concerned about the urgency of climate change and is committed to working together with other stakeholders in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the group is interested in participating in expert groups that focus on specific environmental topics, such as “environment” themed expert groups that could help actors involved in these discussions share best practices or develop government powers concerning the effects of climate change. The Group Altitude also believes that mobile usage should be a major focus of discussion, as well as other non-material aspects of our lives beyond just material possessions (such as energy efficiency interventions). Finally, the Group Altitude urges the Authority to stimulate action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by focusing primarily on known and reliable methods such as reducing energy consumption. Regarding waste management, the Group Altitude has pledged to accelerate its actions over 2021 and has begun recruiting staff specifically focused on this area. The Group Altitude believes that technology should not be viewed only through its emissions perspective; its absence or presence should not determine how we approach it. A concise summary of all the text above would be: 

The Group Altitude is concerned about climate change and wants to participate in expert groups focused on environmental topics. They believe that mobile usage should be a major focus of discussion, along with other non-material aspects of our lives beyond just material possessions. They urge the Authority to stimulate action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by focusing primarily on known and reliable methods such as reducing energy consumption. Regarding waste management, The Group pledges to accelerate its actions over 2021 and has begun recruiting staff specifically focused on this area The text discusses the potential impacts of digital technologies on the environment, and highlights the importance of properly assessing their impact before taking any action that could potentially reduce their benefits. The Avicca (an organization representing public sector entities) is interested in participating in these discussions and has already established partnerships with private sector actors to this end. The text provides a wealth of information on digital infrastructure development, including examples of how digital technologies can be used to improve sustainability across a wide range of sectors. Furthermore, it discusses how public sector organizations can benefit from using digital technologies to improve their operations and services. Finally, the text provides insights into how digital technologies are transforming many aspects of our lives, from our physical environment to our social interactions. The text discusses the importance of management practices that are sustainable, and points out that this is an increasingly important issue as the effects of the digital revolution continue to grow. The model for business that is most likely to be able to combine social and environmental impacts in a positive way is one that takes into account both the economic interests of organizations and their long-term sustainability. It is difficult, however, for producers to maintain ownership over their products in a world where data is constantly being generated. This will lead to increased energy consumption as well as negative impacts on organizational sustainability. The two main issues raised by the text are the need for businesses to develop values that appeal to customers and the equation of value used by companies in order to make profits from their activities. We will discuss two points related to these topics below. 

First, it is necessary for businesses to create values that are relevant and meaningful to consumers. This can be done through creating products with high quality standards while also taking into account environmental concerns such as reducing energy consumption or waste production. Second, companies must find an equation of value that allows them make money from their activities while also protecting shareholder interests. There are many ways this can be accomplished, but ultimately it requires understanding how people use information technology and making strategic decisions based on this knowledge Bouygues Telecom believes that it is essential to take into account both the social and environmental impacts of business operations when developing marketing strategies. To do this, the company has developed a training program for marketeers who want to be more responsible with their marketing practices. Additionally, Bouygues Telecom is working to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases while also expanding its network capacity in order to meet customer demand. These efforts are necessary in order to combat climate change and protect our environment. Over the past decade, there has been a rise in the cost of environmental work due to the global company Recommerce. This includes both the overall system for repairing electronics (which is considered a major part of France's recycling efforts) and individual devices being repaired by their contribution to overall reduction among customers (approximately 2 million devices as of today). The approach taken focuses on balancing efficiency and sustainability while also taking into account how an electronic device will be used over its entire life-cycle, including considerations for subsequent reuse by different users. Despite these efforts, operators cannot simultaneously reduce emissions significantly while meeting increasing customer demand. To address this issue first within the electronics sector and then beyond it, collective action must be undertaken that is equally shared by all actors involved in electronic waste management. Ultimately, it is necessary for policymakers to develop policies that take into account both positive externalities associated with digital technology and other sectors' negative impacts on society as a whole. Such an effort would go beyond simply regulating technology companies according to their own self-interests; it would require guiding them towards effective yet sustainable practices that would worsen existing imbalances in our society. The French government is supporting the development of two major challenges facing the 21st century: transitioning to a digital world that is more environmentally responsible, and reducing energy consumption. The convergence of these two challenges is an opportunity to speed up the transition to a sustainable economy. To do this, we need to use technology more wisely and understand its environmental impact better. We also need to use artificial intelligence (AI) in all aspects of the transition to help us save energy, reduce transportation costs, and improve our environment overall. All economic actors will need to be mobilized in order for this ambitious goal to be achieved. Transparency will be key in ensuring that AI has a positive impact on the environment. The text discusses the importance of reducing environmental impact, and how the development of technology has its own environmental consequences. The main points made are that although 5G represents an improvement in terms of network speed and efficiency, it does not have a significant potential for innovation when it comes to reducing consumer energy consumption or improving sustainability. Consumers may be held responsible for climate change due to their increased demand for data and services. Despite this limitation, the text argues that action on climate change still requires an increase in consumption levels, as opposed to relying solely on technological advances to solve the problem. The text discusses the various environmental consequences of digital technology, and how these issues are only going to get worse as we move forward into the 5G era. The main points made include: 
-Consumption of resources is going to increase as we move towards 5G; 
-The transition to 5G is already causing major problems with our environment; 
-We need to shift away from a consumer-based economy and towards a more sustainable model that takes into account the impact of our technology on the environment. The government should publish, by the end of the year, 50 proposals that were co-constructed with more than fifty intergovernmental strategy on digital and environmental concerns. Actors concerned and engaged in a more sustainable digital world are among the main priorities for the transition to a green and sustainable digital economy, among which Arcep is concerned. A European action is also expected, as concern over the environmental impact of digital technology grows. The three main goals of this roadmap are to achieve a more sustainable digital world through adopting the concept of sustainability in all aspects of our lives; to use technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030; and to create an online toolkit for implementing transversal actions across different transitions related to climate change and digitization. These goals will be achieved through initiatives such as reducing consumption, designing for durability, and bridging high-tech and low-tech sectors around large objectives in transitioning towards a greener society. The text discusses the need for policymakers to focus on reducing environmental impact when developing and implementing innovative technologies. It outlines three main principles that should guide this effort: minimizing the number of different technology platforms in use, focusing on low-tech solutions, and promoting sustainable practices. Finally, it argues that public interest should be a central concern when it comes to innovation policies. Overall, the text discusses the importance of digital technology and how it should be used in a responsible way. It stresses the need for us to focus on only those uses of digital technology that help us maintain our resilience as communites. Furthermore, it is important to preserve democracy in any process related to digital technology, and this has been largely unsuccessful so far due to government efforts focused on "sensibilizing" consumers instead of taking real action. Finally, the text discusses ways in which we can break from current strategies and approaches and move towards more effective solutions that take into account all aspects of our environment. Digital society: Others have done it before me, and Europe needs to support scientific and social forces in order to summarize. France should play a more significant role in this than that.

Reducing negative impacts of the digital age: A structured approach based on understanding leverage points and avoiding pollution transfers is necessary before taking any action. This requires collective effort based on sound science and serious consideration of trends. Covage is a technology company that specializes in the deployment of copper networks on its customers' historical networks. This represents our first step towards reducing our carbon emissions on our individual networks. Fiber also has the potential to improve energy efficiency by connecting mobile and connected devices together. The provision of our services to our active customers constitutes Covage's second-largest source of CO2 emissions. In 2020, Covage aims to reduce its major sources of emissions even further by implementing environmental and responsible practices at every level of its operations: transportation, waste disposal, water consumption, and energy use. Additionally, Covage supports social initiatives with the donation of reusable materials and equipment to refugees, as well as funding projects aimed at compensating for CO2 emissions caused by uncompressed digital files. By monitoring key components such as CO2 emissions from transportation, waste disposal, water consumption, and energy usage along with social initiatives such as recycling rates and public awareness about climate change among employees, Covage hopes to create a more sustainable future for all. Covage is a company that specializes in deploying and managing fiber optic networks. Covage applauds the ARCEP initiative to develop a sustainable digital infrastructure, and notes the innovative equipment (mainly cables made of fiber optic) and participatory platform used by its sub-contractors. Covage believes that reducing the environmental impact of data centers will largely depend on implementing incentives that will encourage all stakeholders in the digital world to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. One key way in which Covage plans to reduce software obsolescence is by making software available under open source licenses after it has been certified as being suitable for long-term use. This would help to reduce emissions from data center hardware consumption, as well as post-usage CO2 emissions. Criteo is a technology company that specializes in providing accurate and relevant marketing campaigns to businesses of all sizes. Their work in the area of environmental impact has focused on the effects that television programming has on the environment, specifically how online video consumption affects air pollution levels. In addition to this research, Criteo has also been working on developing strategies to reduce the environmental impact of its own operations. Some of these strategies include efforts to improve recycling and reuse practices, as well as implementing sustainable business practices such as using green energy sources. Overall, Criteo's goal is to make a positive impact on the environment while also helping businesses succeed. The main points of this text are as follows: 

- Today, the average individual spends 3 hours and 30 minutes per day watching television. 
- Additionally, radio is still widely listened to, with 40.9 million people using it daily. 
- A new reference guide on media usage will be published soon which will include information on digital media use by French citizens aged 10 and over. 
- Digital media consumption has increased in recent years, with video streaming representing 60% of all internet traffic. This trend is likely to continue as more high-speed networks and connected devices are installed in homes. 
- It is important to consider both the user interface design issues that arise from the impact of technology on our environment when thinking about digital sustainability initiatives. The text discusses the various ways in which digital technology can have a negative impact on the environment, and offers suggestions on how designers of digital content and services can make their products more environmentally friendly. One key point made is that it is now important for designers to consider the environmental impacts of their virtual reality productions as well as the overall efficiency of their online systems. It is also important to remember that users are not static entities who will always use technology in the same way; instead, they are constantly evolving and changing their habits, which requires designers to keep up with these changes. Finally, Ericsson stresses the importance of collective action when it comes to addressing issues related to digital sustainability. The text discusses the various ways in which the digital age is impacting the environment, and how we need to be aware of these impacts in order to make informed decisions about how to proceed. It emphasizes the importance of innovation and technology in order to improve our environment, but also stresses the need for caution when it comes to evaluating the long-term effects of certain technologies. The article discusses some of the potential environmental consequences associated with 5G deployment, and provides a brief overview of other technologies that may have similar impacts. Overall, it is important to remember that there are many complex factors at play when it comes to assessing environmental impact, and any action taken must be carefully considered before taking any steps forward. The text discusses the various benefits of different types of technology, with a particular focus on how these technologies can help to reduce climate change. One main point made is that while technology has its own set of environmental impacts, it is important to consider the overall impact that these technologies have when used in conjunction with other forms of production and consumption. In addition, the text highlights the importance of public education in order to encourage users to make informed choices about their technology use. Finally, the text discusses Facebook's goal of becoming completely renewable by 2020 and notes that this goal should be seen as an example for other technological companies as well. Today, thanks to advances in technology, artificial intelligence (AI) centers can optimize energy consumption by understanding user habits and preferences. This has led to reductions in the amount of energy needed to run online services, even as internet traffic has tripled. As Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services since 2015, Thierry Breton has stated that “improvements in demand management measures have more than doubled”106. In terms of online services, Facebook’s own video compression technology is two times faster than its predecessor and uses half the space. Another way to reduce carbon emissions from digital usage is to focus on reducing unintentional use and disabling features when devices are not being used frequently. These measures help devices last longer while also reducing energy consumption.

Overall, digital technologies play an important role in helping reduce carbon emissions by making it easier for people to consume fewer resources overall. messaging services are especially efficient due to their reliance on message content rather than device or network usage. For example, Messenger uses less battery power and storage space than previous versions while still being very fast to start up and running quarter the size of a strategy aimed at reducing environmental impact developed by the European Union107 . The text discusses the importance of having a sustainable digital infrastructure, and points out that while 8 megabits per second (Mbps) is currently the minimum required for 5G service, many rural areas do not yet have access to this level of broadband. It urges all involved in the digital sphere - including telecom providers, content creators, and consumers - to take responsibility for ensuring a sustainable future for technology by being transparent about their practices and making sure their products are beneficial both to users and the environment. The text discusses the importance of reducing digital consumption in order to have a positive impact on the environment. It highlights the need for legislation or regulation that establishes a minimum threshold for broadband speed, and urges companies producing content, advertising, etc. to take responsibility for their impact on society and the environment. Families Rurales (a non-profit organization) is calling for public authorities to establish a legal or regulatory definition of "digital sobriety," with an index score measuring carbon emissions associated with different types of digital content consumption. This would help consumers make informed choices about what they consume and help promote sustainable practices when it comes to online storage, browsing habits, and gaming habits among other things. Families Rurales also recommends that public education campaigns focus on teaching people how their online behavior affects the environment in a meaningful way. In addition, it asks these authorities to create a plan designed to reduce digital consumption by encouraging users to adopt more environmentally-friendly practices when using technology, as well as fund environmental awareness initiatives through taxation of data usage. The text discusses the importance of transitioning to a more sustainable digital economy, and highlights the need for greater efficiency in data consumption. It points out that while progress has been made in this area, we still have a long way to go before we reach an energy-efficient equilibrium. One way to achieve this is through the development of more efficient data architectures, which would compensate for the explosion in data consumption. Prospective technologies that are currently being marketed at large scale (5G and 8K displays, autonomous vehicles, etc.) require careful planning due to their significant environmental impacts. At the same time, these high-usage applications should not be allowed to take precedence over more sustainable resources. The challenge is balancing these competing interests while also ensuring that citizens or NGOs have access to transparent information about them. This poses a major economic issue as it displaces investments into fossil fuels. However, it is important to remember that sustainability cannot be achieved without taking into account social implications – something which requires public input and engagement on a large scale. The 2020 theme for digital responsible and sustainable use will be "the crisis in health has revealed the vast array of ways in which the digital sovereignty of the internet, local governments will have a significant role to play." This includes developing policies that encourage environmentally-friendly mobile and computer usage, maintaining and continuing structural support for public services that rely heavily on digital technology, as well as working to increase public awareness about how to make responsible and sustainable use of digital technologies. Cities are already taking action on these fronts by promoting sustainability initiatives within their businesses, communities, schools, etc. Ultimately this process will help cities better understand their needs and priorities so they can more effectively allocate resources towards projects that are most important to them. The text discusses the importance of telecommunications in terms of their environmental impact, and how this impact is likely to increase in the future as more and more people adopt digital technologies. The main points made are that telecommunications are a key sector responsible for generating greenhouse gas emissions, and that action needs to be taken to address this issue before any new regulations or controls are put in place. The study presented by the FFTélécoms suggests that telecoms companies are key players in reducing environmental impacts, and that further efforts must be made to promote sustainable practices within this sector. The text discusses the importance of environmentalism in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It notes that the majority of growth in greenhouse gas emissions comes from imported equipment connected to the internet (primarily devices with large screens, such as TVs, computers, etc.), and content datacenters (mainly GAFAN). As a result, all actors involved in digital technology - including global giants - must work together to create a more sustainable online environment. Any new environmental regulation must take into account relevant European levels of action to avoid burdening only national actors and sparking unintended consequences.

KEY POINTS: 

-Environmentalism is important for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
-The majority of growth in greenhouse gas emissions comes from imported equipment connected to the internet and content datacenters. 
-To create a more sustainable online environment, all actors involved in digital technology need to cooperate. New environmental regulation should take into account relevant European levels of action. The text discusses the impact of the digital age on ecosystems and how this is causing growing environmental vulnerability. It highlights the need for solutions that take into account both the digital ecosystem's impact on human societies and its own sustainability. One way to improve resilience against such risks is to consider ACV (actual cost of technology) when making decisions about technologies. This summary provides a high-level overview of key points made in the text, including an overview of digital ecosystems, ACV, and their impacts on environmental vulnerability. Every year, 50 million tons of new electronic equipment and electronics waste are created, requiring more resources or requiring twice the amount of recycled materials than is currently being produced. That's 5,000 Eiffel Towers. TVs and other electronics with increased numbers of connected devices. 70% of these wastes are exported illegally to countries in Africa, India, Pakistan and Thailand specifically. The French electronics industry is lagging behind its global competitors when it comes to data center infrastructure development - this lack of independence has serious consequences for both economic opportunity and environmental sustainability. The GIMELEC is pleased to observe a growing awareness among businesses about the need for a holistic view when it comes to digital transformation - as evidenced by recent Science magazine findings that show "digital confining" discussions within different technology sectors have thus far resulted in limited progress. Industry leaders at the GIMELEC are ready and willing to contribute their expertise towards unlocking greater innovation potential through breaking down silos and developing cross-sectoral collaborations. These efforts will help ensure that France retains its national security and ecological independence in an increasingly digital world The text discusses the importance of reducing environmental impact when it comes to digital technology, and provides examples of how companies are trying to do this. One such company is Google, which has set a goal of using renewable energy sources by 2030 for all its operations. Another company that is making efforts to reduce its environmental impact is Apple, which recently announced that all of its products will be made with recycled materials by 2020. The text also mentions other companies who are making similar commitments, including Facebook and Amazon. Overall, these companies are demonstrating that it is possible to reduce environmental impact while still maintaining high levels of productivity and innovation. In 2025, data centers will be able to provide more power through computational advances, while Google pledges to eliminate plastic from its packaging using the same amount of energy as it takes to run their servers. Additionally, by using machine learning, they have been able to reduce energy consumption for cooling "zero waste" systems at all of their sites by 30%. YouTube offers users a way to recycle used devices for free. By adjusting video quality based on various factors such as internet speed, screen size, and original video quality, YouTube aims to provide an optimal viewing experience for each user. When a user watches a video, YouTube provides them with additional videos to watch via automatic playback feature. Users can disable this feature at any time by accessing the viewing settings page in their profile. Every user is able to see how long they watched a video and whether they paused it or had it timed-out using their profile's stats page. These tools are designed help users better understand how they use YouTube and disconnect if needed while also providing guidance on how long videos should be watched before being deleted. The text discusses the importance of being mindful of our digital resources and how to conserve them responsibly. It discusses the negative impacts that overuse of digital resources has on both the environment and humanity, and offers a variety of ways in which we can reduce our consumption. The text also provides advice on how to create sustainable online habits for all members of the family. The text discusses the importance of being environmentally conscious when it comes to using digital media. It points out that, due to the high energy consumption associated with digital media use, a large number of people are beginning to realize the need to consume less content that is sourced through digital means. The article goes on to discuss how individuals can become more environmentally conscious when it comes to their digital media habits by adopting various eco-friendly practices. These include designing and manufacturing electronic equipment in a more sustainable way, teaching children about the importance of conserving resources, and relying on international standards when developing software or hardware. Finally, the article provides some tips for businesses who want to make their online presence more environmentally friendly. The text discusses the importance of reducing the impact that digital technology has on the environment, and young people are especially aware of this issue. Nearly half (48%) of 15-24 year olds believe that digital technology has a very strong or strong impact on the environment, compared to 38% of those over 40. This awareness is likely due to the increasing number of environmental concerns being raised in relation to 5G technologies. When asked what they think is the biggest impact that digital consumption has on the environment, 66% of respondents say it consumes a lot of energy, while 73% consider it to be a very big problem. In order to encourage people to consume less digital content, solutions need to be found beyond just advertising campaigns that focus only on reducing physical product consumption. The text discusses the two main types of obsolescence that affect electronic equipment: physical obsolescence, which is caused by the wear and tear on the equipment itself, and logical obsolescence, which is due to the expiration of software or hardware capabilities. The article goes on to say that both forms of obsolescence are becoming more common as technology evolves and newer, more advanced versions of software and hardware become available. In order to combat these issues, HOP/Halte à l’obsolescence programmée calls for policies that promote an extended lifespan for electronics devices as well as increased reuse and reconditioning opportunities. Additionally, a usage meter for electronic products would help consumers better understand how their devices are being used and could lead to increased demand for secondhand electronics. The text discusses the importance of innovation in the culture sector, and how it is essential to address current environmental challenges. It highlights the need for companies to develop sustainable practices when making digital investments, and calls for greater transparency from those responsible for software updates. The article also urges policymakers to consider ways to incentivize sustainable consumption habits among consumers, and provide training for company leaders on how best to manage digital resources responsibly. Finally, it recommends developing a common measurement toolkit to track and report on cultural uses of technology that have negative environmental impacts. The text discusses the importance of environmental and social sustainability in the digital age, and how it is essential for cultural professionals to think about ways to reduce their impact on the environment. The article highlights the work of a collective called Les Augures, which aims to help cultural institutions transition towards more sustainable practices. One key strategy that Les Augures plans to implement is working together with other stakeholders to create shared networks that will allow for rational use of resources. Additionally, the Mel plans to promote waste prevention and recycling initiatives as well as stronger ties with eco-organizations or electronic equipment distributors. By taking these proactive steps, the MEL hopes to ensure that its territory can be used sustainably while also accommodating current needs and future growth. The MEL is a cooperative organization that was established in 2013 with the goal of promoting environmentally friendly communication practices. The MEL has drafted a environmental communications charter with operators, and it considers installing antennas-relays to be an important way to share data about the impact and cost of their infrastructure. In addition, the success of deploying a 4G network in Lille metro shows the importance of objective measurement when it comes to climate change. The MEL is also supportive of transitioning to a model where multiple operators are responsible for providing services to final customers. While acknowledging the benefits of competition, the MEL regrets that there is no migration equipment included in the experimental project for sharing buildings (PMI). Finally, in order to encourage sustainable digital behavior and reduce waste, the MEL calls on the state to develop a national plan for prevention of digital addiction among children. The method of quantifying environmental impacts known as "Analysis of Cycle of Life" (ACV), a standardized method, is an important tool for taking into account the holistic implications of digital services. The increasing use of ACV in sectors such as information technology and construction has the potential to benefit society as a whole, while also ensuring that environmental commitments are met. In addition, since 2010, France and Europe have established Analysis of Cycle of Life as an essential support for public awareness campaigns about the environmental impact of digital goods and services. Furthermore, a design-based approach to assessing environmental impacts associated with digital technologies must take into account human resources resources involved (the exhaustive "functional" approach). All told, it is necessary to move forward towards a life-oriented perspective when considering the environmental impacts associated with digital technologies across all aspects--physical assets (such as equipment or "virtualized" IT systems), networks and data centers, in addition to users' resources (including both physical and cognitive). These are complex issues that require comprehensive analysis at both national and supra-national levels. The study and management of service usage through ACV will serve as the foundation for effective communication strategies aimed at raising public awareness about the environmental impact of digital consumption. The text discusses the importance of technologies such as satellite Internet in order to improve our environment. Satellite Internet offers high-speed connections that are already integrated into an environmentally responsible and sustainable approach. It is important to take these types of technologies into account when planning our infrastructure, in order to reduce the amount of resources we consume and make it easier to compare results from different studies. Additionally, satellite technology can be used to manage waste and conserve energy, both of which are important issues that need attention worldwide. By understanding these issues and taking action on a global scale, we can help improve the environment for future generations. Satellite internet is a reliable and affordable way to access the internet from anywhere in the world. It is especially useful for people who live in remote or rural areas, or who have difficulty accessing traditional internet services.

Numerisat believes that consumers should have more control over their online habits, and that they should be encouraged to use less-expensive, longer-lasting technology products. To this end, Numerisat has developed strategies aimed at reducing consumer consumption while also increasing the lifespan of its products. These include developing adaptive pricing schemes that are tailored to individual users’ needs, as well as recycling and reusing equipment when possible. In addition, Numerisat offers short-term plans that are tailored to seasonal needs such as fishing season or hunting season. Finally, the company strives to create an environmentally friendly infrastructure by minimizing installation costs and using recycled materials whenever possible. OVHcloud is a French company that specializes in providing virtualized resources for businesses. The company has been committed to reducing its environmental impact since it was founded in 1995, and aims to achieve "zero emissions" by 2030. To do this, OVHcloud is focusing its efforts on five key areas: the environmental impact of industry, the design of infrastructure for renewable energy, promotion of circular economy practices within the company, mobilizing its stakeholders towards sustainability, and continuous innovation in cycles shortening. Significant efforts have been made by the industry as a whole to reduce environmental impact; however, OVHcloud stands out due to its own initiative in building their own servers and using renewable energy sources. Data centers use a lot of energy, and this trend is only going to continue as the internet becomes more popular. In 2003, cloud computing was still in its early stages and didn't have a significant impact on energy consumption. However, over the past 10 years, there has been little to no increase in energy consumption for data centers overall. This is likely due to improvements made in technology and the increasing use of cloud-based services. It's also important to note that while data centers are using more energy than ever before, they're doing so at a slower rate than before. To improve efficiency even further, companies like OVHcloud are partnering with institutes like Inria to better understand their impact on the environment. The text discusses the pros and cons of data-center construction, focusing on the issue of energy consumption. One potential alternative to data-centers is "smart building," or buildings that are able to intelligently manage their own energy needs. Qarnot's Energy Reuse Effectiveness platform allows for the efficient distribution of computing power, which can reduce energy consumption in data-centers. Additionally, smart cities are becoming increasingly important as they become more reliant on digital technologies. By taking advantage of intelligent technology, such as microprocessors and fiber optic networks, cities can improve their overall security and sustainability. The text discusses the concept of "smart cities," which are municipalities or buildings that are equipped with intelligent technology in order to reduce their carbon emissions and save money on energy costs. One example of this is a company called Qarnot, which has developed a system that distributes heat directly from computers in data centers to nearby buildings, reducing the city's carbon footprint by 89%. The article also discusses how smart cities could be used to improve research productivity and efficiency, as well as climate change predictions. It concludes by noting that more work needs to be done in order to accurately predict the effects of smart cities on global climate change. The text discusses the importance of ecoconscious design in the digital age, and how it is essential for businesses to transition towards more sustainable practices. The main points made are that businesses must reduce their environmental impact, and that the digital sector is one of the most energy-intensive sectors out there. In order to make this transition as smooth as possible, it is important to have a clear understanding of what sustainability looks like in the digital age. To do this, researchers need access to data on environmental impacts across all industries, not just the digital one. Furthermore, we need to raise awareness about how our consumption habits affect our environment – especially when it comes to electronics and energy use. Finally, we need to create a pathway into mainstream adoption of good web practices – such as accessibility and security – so that all companies can benefit from them. The text discusses the importance of data accuracy in order to make sound business decisions, and points out that while data availability is improving, it still lacks certain key details from some of the major players in the industry. It goes on to say that in order to achieve better data accuracy, companies must work together with policymakers and other stakeholders. Finally, the text stresses the need for companies to rethink their entire approach to digital innovation in light of its environmental impacts.

Essentially, this text is discussing how important it is for businesses to have accurate data in order to make smart decisions about their operations. In addition, it urges businesses to collaborate with government officials and other stakeholders in order to create a more sustainable future for all involved. Finally, it emphasizes the need for businesses to be proactive when designing future digital systems – taking into account both environmental and social factors. The text discusses the importance of environmental and social responsibility in business, and how it is essential for companies to regain the trust of their customers. It goes on to say that businesses need to be exemplary in order to regain public trust, and that it is important to consider all aspects of a product or service's life cycle before making decisions. Finally, the text urges businesses to use best practices when it comes to digital operations, cloud migration, company networking, waste management and more.

In terms of data consumption, TeleCoop notes that the economic model employed by telecom providers such as operators who offer unlimited data plans to their customers is not sustainable. These companies are also not responsible for the environmental impacts of their actions - often ignoring issues such as over-consumption of data resources or lack of awareness about social implications in countries where metals are mined. Companies with 500 or more employees are encouraged to have a website that meets modern design standards and uses less bandwidth than usual - while also being socially responsible in terms of resource consumption and customer behavior. TeleCoop is a company that designs eco-friendly products based on a set of standards known as the RGAA, or Rehabilitation Guidelines for Adults with Aids. TeleCoop believes that it is important to be transparent about the impacts of technology on the environment, and has called for public disclosure of the environmental impacts of 5G development. TeleCoop also believes that policymakers should take into account the negative environmental effects of telecommunications when making decisions about how to develop and use technology. The Shift Project believes that it is necessary to take both environmental and technological measures in order to combat climate change. One important measure that needs to be taken is prioritizing digital uses that have a positive impact on the environment, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, policymakers need to take into account the long-term sustainability of digital technologies when making decisions about projects and policies. Another important point made in the text is that customers should be encouraged to keep their devices for an extended period of time by offering incentives like subsidized replacements or reduced fees for device renewals. Finally, policymakers need to make sure that transitioning from traditional technologies towards digital ones does not have a negative environmental impact. Measures like encouraging users to keep their devices for an extended period of time can help reduce energy consumption and emissions associated with technology use overall. The text discusses the importance of limiting the use of unlimited data plans offered by telecommunications providers, and discouraging practices that are abusive or unfair towards consumers. It also stresses the need for companies to take responsibility for their impact on the environment, and to make significant changes in how they approach digital consumption in order to be more environmentally sustainable. Tibco, a company that has been involved in repairing electronic cards since its creation 36 years ago, is now working towards becoming a responsible digital citizen by promoting sustainable uses of technology across all aspects of its business. Some of Tibco's current actions include transitioning its fleet to electric vehicles, digitizing contracts and documents, and raising awareness about good digital habits among its employees. In the text, we are discussing the various ways in which Tibco is working to become more environmentally friendly. One of these ways is by transitioning to using green energy sources. Tibco has also committed itself to being a responsible corporate citizen by taking measures such as implementing sustainable practices in its accounting and financial systems. In addition, Tibco is working on developing a comprehensive system-wide strategy that will encompass all aspects of its business operations. Finally, it is important to remember that humans are also integral part of this equation - everyone at Tibco must be mindful of their health and well-being while carrying out their work duties, and the company will continue to prioritize protecting human resources throughout this transformation process. The text discusses the potential impacts of 5G on the environment, and urges regulators to take into account both the “enaval” (downstream) regulation of data practices by consumers, as well as “enamont” (upstream) regulation of professional data practices. The perspective of reducing consumer environmental impact is accepted only if this reduction can be effectively realized through transparent data management practices on the part of professionals. The proposal for a law aimed at reducing digital footprints in France is discussed, and it is noted that such a measure would have significant implications for consumers. For example, limiting mobile data usage could redefine current market landscape by segmenting offerings more sharply and potentially depriving consumers with limited financial resources access to necessary services. The text discusses the importance of internet access and how it can be used to improve the world. It goes on to discuss how technology such as LED lighting and smart transportation can be used to improve the world in a positive way, while also reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. Vodafone is committed to reducing its environmental impact in a number of ways, including through increased efficiency when using energy resources, reduced waste production from its networks, and ambitious sustainability goals for all of its operations across Europe and Africa by 2021. The text discusses the importance of reducing one's carbon footprint, and provides examples of ways in which businesses can do this. One important way to reduce one's carbon footprint is to use less energy overall. Vodafone has invested in projects that promote energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, resulting in annual savings of 186 gigawatt-hours (GWh). In July 2020, Vodafone announced a new goal of helping its customers reduce their own emissions by 350 million tonnes over 10 years. Applications that help customers conserve energy include intelligent meters that monitor consumption, and Wifirst is committed to developing best practices for minimizing the carbon footprint of data flows across networks. While it is not possible for Wifirst to be fully responsible for reducing the impact of its data usage on the environment, it recognizes that mitigating these impacts is an important part of our mission as a company. 1. Text discusses the importance of reducing emissions from telecommunications networks, and provides examples of how this can be done. 
2. One way to reduce emissions is to use wired or wireless networks that are more energy efficient than cell phones. 
3. The Arcep has proposed a number of actions that could be taken to build sustainable telecommunications networks, including developing standards and implementing taxes or subsidies. The digital world has a significant environmental impact, and it is important that policymakers take this into account when regulating the industry. Three key pillars are necessary to help reduce the environmental impact of the digital age: better data collection, analysis, and action; stronger incentives for businesses and users to reduce their online footprint; and increased responsibility on all stakeholders involved in the digital ecosystem.

Data collection is essential for understanding how much an individual's online activity impacts the environment. However, current data gathering mechanisms are not sufficient. Therefore, policymakers need to develop more detailed measurements of an individual's online footprint in order to make informed decisions about how best to regulate the industry.

Incentives are also needed to encourage businesses and users to reduce their environmental impact. These incentives should be tailored specifically for each sector or type of user behavior. For example, one proposal suggests providing financial rewards for companies that achieve lower energy consumption or emissions levels.

Finally, all stakeholders must be responsible for reducing their own environmental impact when using technology. This includes both individuals and companies who design and deploy technology products/services. The text discusses the various factors that influence the environmental impact of networks, including the consumption of users, type of services used, and so on. It is noted that beyond this, it is also important to note how regular references are made to the production phase being the most important for network-related emissions. This is due to the fact that equipment used in communications (such as internet service providers or phone companies) produces a large majority of greenhouse gas emissions during this stage. Other key players in network production include manufacturers of telecommunications devices and content delivery networks (CDNs). These third parties can either operate directly through their distributors or work together with established telecom carriers. The environmental impact of data centers falls into two main categories: those managed by telecom carriers themselves (usually through approved FCA agents), and new entrants such as content delivery network operators or cloud storage providers. Both types of actors have an impact on data center sustainability by dictating how resources are allocated and influencing how easily they can be repaired or replaced. Terminals, which allow for equipment to be placed within the center, and then to consume content and applications in use, are used to dimension the center’s size based on the demand from users. There are several reasons why terminals are sized this way: 1) due to the resources required by OS and application volumes produced and stored; 2) because of the type of services and energy consumed by these volumes of data. For example, accessing content and applications offered by providers is necessary for users to be able to do so; both physically (via centers of data) as well as electronically (via networks). Additionally, these same providers must store their data in terminals in order for it to be accessible by users. Finally,terminals must also be constantly updated with new content in order that users have access to the latest features and functionality available.

Regulation seems necessary when it comes to environmental matters beyond just transparency – gathering accurate data about an entity’s impact can help regulators move forward on more permanent decisions regarding that entity’s environment. In a perpetual state of innovation, sectoral regulators are increasingly relying upon precise measurement tools in order to assess an entity’s environmental impact. The text discusses the importance of using "regulation by data" in order to better understand and manage environmental issues related to user choices in the digital world. This approach involves collecting data from users in order to better understand their preferences and behaviors, and then using this information to guide public policy decisions. One important step in this process is ensuring that data is collected systematically and accurately, so that it can be used effectively to inform users' choices and spur action on behalf of policymakers. In 2019, several regulatory bodies issued a report recommending the use of regulation by data as a way to improve transparency and reduce asymmetries of information across different stakeholders. The group of generals, in order to discuss transversal topics and steer work and discussions in common. This group is currently composed of eight institutions.

142. Arcep, Autorité de la concurrence, AMF, Arafer, CNIL, CRE, CSA, Nouvelles modalités de régulation – La régulation par la donnée (July 2019). In order to formalize their thoughts and convey the progress made on regulation through data. These studies have allowed the Arcep to identify two main objectives: amplifying its ability to act beyond strengthening its human resources and illuminating regulatory choices or financial considerations; introducing user-friendly data collection tools. The joint note highlights the legal means allowing the regulator to understand also the environmental implications of digital usage and inform stakeholders about their responsibilities in relation to online regulation. 

3.1.3 Identify indicators that reflect an environment’s overall impact across all sectors involved 
Maintaining a data collection effort that covers not only those regulated but also all actors involved in online ecosystem sustainability would require extending the range of data available for analysis, developing new tools for crowdsourcing environmental information as well as possessing expertise and new tools not yet available. The proposed indicators will be based on ongoing research projects or already underway action plans aimed at understanding online ecosystem sustainability . Collected information will be essential for adapting action plans accordingly while providing policymakers with a snapshot of current digital ecosystem conditions . The Arcep is currently prepared to carry out an exercise on other topics, and is willing to participate in a similar effort on communications electronic emissions. In practice, the Arcep has already committed itself in this direction, within the limits of its current capabilities. It would be desirable that such an undertaking be conducted at a European or international level. 

A range of proposals are being put forward by the actors involved in this discussion: The Arcep is ready to collect environmental indicators at various levels of operation, from individual operators to large internet service providers (ISPs). Additional studies are needed, including investigations into greenhouse gas emissions from electronic communication devices as well as data disaggregation by “scope” operational sector. This task will require further study before any specific proposals can be made. Progress must be gradual in order to avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once. The text discusses the importance of collecting data from operators of communications networks in order to better understand the impact that digital technologies have on the environment. Various indicators are proposed as ways to measure this impact, and it is important to collect data from a variety of sources in order to get a comprehensive picture. In addition, it is necessary to approach data collection gradually in order to avoid overwhelming network operators with too much information at once. Ultimately, achieving environmental goals will require both reducing digital technology consumption and increasing energy efficiency across all forms of digital media. 

One way that digital technology consumption can be reduced is by encouraging companies to adopt more sustainable business practices. For example, reducing energy use during operation or transitioning towards more environmentally-friendly materials when manufacturing products. Another way to reduce energy consumption is through improving communication between different parts of the digital ecosystem. For instance, understanding how devices are using electricity and coordinating actions between different players in the online space (such as internet service providers, device manufacturers, etc.). Collecting data on these types of interactions will help us better understand how users are using technology and what needs improvement. 

While reducing energy consumption is essential for mitigating environmental damage caused by digital technologies, it cannot be done alone; other strategies must also be employed if we hope to achieve long-term success. One such strategy involves incentivizing companies to reduce their carbon footprint by promoting renewable energy sources (such as solar or wind power). By doing so, we can help shift the burden away from traditional carbon emitters (like factories) and place it squarely on those who benefit most from climate change (like wealthy individuals living in coastal areas). 

Overall, collecting data about the impacts of digital technologies on the environment is important for two primary reasons: firstly, it allows us track progress made towards our environmental goals; secondly – and more importantly – it provides us with insights into which interventions might work best in order reduce overall emissions levels The text discusses various aspects of telecommunications, including the role of opera- tors in this field. It explains that operators are important information resources, and that it is necessary to collect data from these entities in order to better understand their environmental impact. The article also mentions the need to produce terminals underlying current technology, and to collect data on GES emissions from operators across different segments of networks (access, transmission, core network). By doing so, technicians would be able to identify more effectively which levers and impacts may be driving changes in energy consumption. The text discusses the importance of collecting information about the emissions and lifecycle of electronic equipment in order to create useful indices that can help policymakers make informed decisions about how to best support these industries. The main points discussed include the need for data on new, non-subventioned, and refurbished electronics as well as data on the usage and emissions of electronic equipment by operators and their consumers. Additionally, an index measuring recyclability could be useful in addition to indicators measuring reliability and durability. All of this information should be collected starting in 2021 and 2024, with a goal of having it ready by January 2021 and January 2024, respectively. While ensuring secrecy is important, collecting this information is necessary in order to provide accurate insights into industry trends while also protecting consumer privacy. The text discusses the importance of collecting data on consumer behavior and energy consumption in order to better understand how to reduce waste and save energy. It provides examples of data that could be collected, including information on emissions from various types of products, levels of recycling, and use of electronic devices. The text also discusses the role that suppliers of content (such as online platforms or app developers) may play in reducing waste and promoting sustainable consumption habits. Finally, it suggests ways in which data collection at this level might be carried out initially, with a focus on emissions from products manufactured by major providers of content. The digital world is constantly evolving and impacting the physical world. This is especially true in terms of how our digital lives are connected to one another and the ways in which they affect our physical behavior. One important area where this connection manifests itself is through the way we use electronic communications devices, such as phones, computers, and tablets.

One of the main ways that these devices are impacted by digital life is through the data that they collect. This data can be used to track users’ movements, habits, and preferences, among other things. In addition to tracking user activity, electronic communications devices also generate a great deal of waste (such as unused data) that must be disposed of in a responsible manner.

All of this information has implications for how we design and operate our digital lives. For example, it's important to understand how users interact with various types of content (such as advertisements), as well as how their usage patterns impact system performance or resource consumption. By gathering accurate information about these issues, we can make better decisions about how best to serve users and protect resources alike. The text discusses the various models used to market and distribute services and terminals, with a focus on the role played by each party involved in their definition. Among these models are those of purchase, rental, or sharing of terminals. The impacts of these models on consumer behavior and technology obsolescence are also discussed. Finally, data collection efforts aimed at understanding the energy consumption of information technology (IT) equipment are mentioned. The text discusses the environmental impact of data centers, and how it can be reduced through better design and management. First, key points about data center design are made, including considerations for energy efficiency and environmental impact. Next, information on green data centers is summarized. Finally, a study on greening cloud computing and electronic communications services and networks is discussed. Data centers are often full of servers that are "comatose," meaning they're physically active but don't contribute anything to the network or consume any resources. This is a growing problem, as it means that more capital is being wasted on inactive servers. There are several indicators that can be used to measure this problem, and researchers are currently working to make these data public so that decision-makers can better understand the state of enterprise data centers. The text discusses the need for environmental indicators to be developed in order to improve the sustainability of information technology (IT) products and services. It goes on to discuss how emissions from different types of IT products and services can be measured, as well as the various impacts these emissions have on the environment. Finally, it provides examples of environmental indicators that could be used to measure the sustainability of IT products and services. The text discusses the importance of integrating environmental considerations into network design and operation. It points out that, while 4G and 5G networks are designed to be more efficient than 3G and 2G networks, they still consume a lot of energy in comparison to traditional wired networks. In order to reduce energy consumption on these networks, the Arcep recommends taking environmental factors into account when designing and operating them. This includes evaluating technologies based on their absolute energy consumption rather than just comparing them based on their relative performance. Furthermore, the Arcep urges the transition from mobile broadband technologies based on cellular radio frequencies (3G, 4G, and 5G) to those based on optical fiber transmission. These latter networks are considered more environmentally friendly because they require no unnecessary traffic congestion or transmission interference. The text discusses the various technologies available to telecommunications providers, and how their respective performance characteristics can affect customer choice. It also highlights the importance of taking into account a technology's dependence on traffic levels when making comparisons, as well as its potential for substitution by other technologies in specific cases. The article concludes with a call for greater awareness of fiber-optic networks and their potential advantages over traditional copper networks, in order to facilitate the transition to this more energy-efficient technology.

The main points that are covered in this text include: 

1. Different telecommunications technologies have different performance characteristics that can impact customer choice. 
2. Technologies that are newer and more recently deployed tend to be more energy efficient than older ones, but they don't take into account a technology's dependence on traffic levels or substitutability between different technologies. 
3. The Arcep has called for greater awareness of fiber-optic networks and their potential advantages over traditional copper networks in order to facilitate the transition to this more energy-efficient technology. The internet is available at high speeds and is vigilant to television. Ten years ago, the operators decided that this transition would preserve gaming by deploying competing networks and leaving no fiber-optic user until the subscriber (FttH) allowing for a very high-speed internet connection S’il est inévitable que cette phase de transition entre le cuivre et la fibre se caractérise par la coexistence momentanée de deux réseaux filaires, l’Autorité d’État estime que le projet d’Orange, dont elle félicite et qu’elle tient à saluer dans son principe, reste encore largement à consommation énergétique de l’infrastructure ferroviaire. La consommation de la fibre est ainsi estimée comme trois à quatre fois moindre que pour une ligne cuivre. Ce bénéfice ne se prolonge pas, qu’Orange puisse s’inscrire sur le podium des opérateurs télécoms raccordés au cuivre en termes de consommation énergétique. La fibre présente un impact environnemental amélioré par rapport au réseau cuivré (ADSL ou RTC161) s’agissant du principe, reste encore largement à assurer pour une infrastructure ferroviaire qui souffrirait déjà fortement du manque d'investissement depuis plusieurs années. La transition vers la fibre devrait permettre à terme aux utilisateurs finalitaires d'assurer une meilleure empreinte environnementale des appareils connectés directement aux France Stratégie, in order to maximize the efficiency of its energy consumption, is looking to take advantage of advances in technology while also promoting sustainable practices. Some key points that were discussed include the need for better anticipation of construction projects and better coordination between various stakeholders involved in such projects. Additionally, the Arcep has proposed creating groups focused on specific energy-related issues in order to improve efficiency and reduce waste. Regarding copper networks, Orange announced plans to gradually shut down its network by 2023 due to obsolescence and a growing demand for other technologies. Fiber networks are also subject to obsolescence and must be managed accordingly; for example, when two fiber networks are built using different technologies next to each other, it is necessary for one network to be mutuallyized with the operators in order to optimize utilization and minimize duplication of infrastructure footprints. Participants at France Stratégie's platform have also raised concerns about good engineering practice being undermined by lax regulation governing construction activities near protected sites or important infrastructure assets. In order to address these issues, France Stratégie proposes working with telecom providers as well as individual engineers during group discussions aimed at determining best practices for constructing telecommunications networks. Finally, it was noted that deploying new telecommunications technologies can have a significant environmental impact if they are not properly managed from start-to-finish. To help ensure responsible deployment of these new technologies while minimizing environmental damage, France Stratégie encourages mutualization among telecom providers or joint ventures between operators and suppliers The text discusses the importance of infrastructure in relation to the environment, and highlights the role that civil engineering plays in this regard. It explains how outdated technology used for mobile phone networks can have a negative impact on the environment, and points out that if 2G and 3G networks were to be discontinued soon, it would require a significant amount of resources to replace them. This would put an enormous burden on network operators and could lead to the gradual attrition of mobile phone capabilities over time. If this situation were to arise, it would require careful planning in order to ensure that replacement technologies are available when needed. The text discusses the potential for networks to replace several hundred thousand ball bearings. Older technologies (2G million terminals, which would have a significant environmental impact) cannot meet the cost-effective needs of high-speed networks, but they are better understood than newer technologies (4G and 5G). However, these new technologies are more energy efficient, providing a reduction in environmental impact over time. It is still unclear which network development path will be followed: extinction of older technologies or continued use of legacy networks with reduced capacity. Two other ideas to consider are: first, that residual traffic on 2G and 3G markets remains significant; and second, that foreign examples show a reallocation of resources freed up by discontinuing older technology deployments. Both concepts require prior conditions to be met - such as widespread migration to newer networks - before they can take hold. Recent studies have shown that 2G and 3G networks still serve the best in terms of connectivity within buildings and rural areas, even though they are no longer being used as much today. This is due to the fact that many "consumers" of communication networks use multiple technologies, which means that extinction of these technologies does not necessarily change consumer behavior. On the market for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, which represents 20 million objects with communication needs, 97% of those devices operate on 3G networks. The impact on environmental sustainability of extinction of technology is thus very important for operators evaluating this issue. In particular, it is complex to assess the impacts on network performance when considering regulatory aspects related to mobile phone usage during emergency calls from vehicles. At its level, the Arcep proposes assessing environmental impacts in addition to network performance when characterizing network quality. This requires revisiting user information and incentives towards sustainable development efforts by operators. > Add a dimension environment In 2021, eyes will add a dimension of consumer environmental quality to their annual surveys of service quality. Mobile deployments are increasingly guided by market-based objectives (such as coverage areas and quality of service for the user) rather than solely based on technical considerations (such as network capacity). The Arcep is proposing to study consumer environmental impacts in connection with network coverage. This illustrates the challenge of balancing societal choices (such as reducing network impact) with the need for an appropriate balance between performance and environmental impact. Key physical levers that have been mentioned include: increasing competition among operators; developing new technologies such as edge computing or cloud-RAN170; and considering how new services might be designed to reduce environmental impact. These issues will likely become even more important in light of evolving technology trends, such as edge computing and cloud-RAN170, which are creating new opportunities but also raising new questions about opportunity sharing and sustainability. The future of computing will allow for a choice between centralized or distributed networks, as well as the use of smaller cells that can improve network efficiency. Environmental impact will be reduced by optimizing network usage and using intelligent technologies to manage networks more effectively. Additionally, virtualization and logicialization of networks are also important tools in reducing environmental impact. However, these solutions require further development before they can be put into practice. Meanwhile, regulatory authorities have at their disposal a number of tools to help reduce environmental impact in the meantime. The text discusses the importance of infrastructure and how it can impact both the environment and business operations. It outlines several key points related to infrastructure, including the need for better planning when designing networks, as well as strategies for reducing environmental impacts associated with network usage. Finally, the text provides a glimpse into future trends in infrastructure development that could have significant implications for both environmental and business concerns.

MAIN COMPONENTS: 

-Infrastructure is important for both environmental and business reasons
-There are many ways to reduce environmental impacts associated with network usage
-Future trends in infrastructure development could have significant implications for both environmental and business concerns The text discusses the importance of transitioning to a digital world and how this will require a coordinated and harmonized approach between different levels of government. It also discusses the impact that digital technology has on the environment, and how policymakers must take these factors into account when crafting policies. Finally, it mentions some important European initiatives related to information and communication technology (ICT) that aim to improve sustainability outcomes in various sectors. The European Union has a number of policies in place aimed at encouraging the use of eco-friendly practices and reducing the environmental impact of businesses. These include directives on energy efficiency, waste management, and product design. In addition, there are a number of initiatives specifically related to telecommunications and electronic goods. One such initiative is the development of a market for sustainable electronics, which would create a single online platform where users could find information on products that are environmentally friendly and/or repairable. Another initiative is the creation of guidelines for responsible data handling in telecommunications, in order to help end users make more informed choices about their consumption habits. Finally, the EU is working to promote connectivity through measures that take into account environmental concerns. This includes developing criteria for assessing whether new technologies have an environmentally harmful effect, as well as implementing strategies to reduce these effects once they do exist. The text discusses the importance of reducing the environmental impact of network deployment, and offers a variety of strategies for accomplishing this. Among these are encouragements for better practices and incentives to encourage reduced environmental impact in network deployment. Finally, it is important to reinforce incentives for economic and user actors to take into account the environmental impact of their actions. Strategies for doing this include encouraging reductions in device replacement rates, as well as increasing awareness of the environmental implications of software obsolescence. Collecting accurate information on both hardware and software obsolescence is essential in order to make informed regulatory decisions about how best to manage these issues. The text discusses the various ways in which technology can be harmful to users, and how these harms can be mitigated. It covers topics such as obsolescence culture, the impact of technology on the environment, and user experience. One key issue that is discussed is the fact that many devices are designed to become obsolete much more quickly than they should, leading to increased environmental waste and decreased user satisfaction. In order to address these issues, it is suggested that manufacturers be given a legal right to repair broken devices. Additionally, policies aimed at limiting software obsolescence should be implemented in order to ensure that devices last longer. Finally, it is stressed that user experience must be taken into account when designing new technologies; if this isn't done, users will eventually grow tired of using outdated or malfunctioning products. The European Union is working to establish a "right to full repair." If the owner of a digital terminal is very attached to a specific service, such as photo editing or messaging, they may not be able to access other services (such as battery life or sustainability information) that could be reasons enough for them to switch terminals. In order to improve the accessibility and awareness of sustainability issues, manufacturers may implement methods such as designing products with durability in mind from the start. These measures would also include reducing environmental impact by avoiding sources of heat buildup and using standardized components in devices that are controlled by operating systems. Acting on mature OSes is critical for ensuring durable digital terminals overall. The text discusses the importance of taking environmental into account when designing and updating software applications. It notes that there are a limited number of actors who are already responsible for this task, and that it is important to develop ways to better understand these actors’ practices in order to improve the sustainability of software products. One possible way to achieve this goal would be to encourage existing software producers to adopt standards-based eco-design practices, which would help reduce the amount of obsolete content on platforms. Additionally, improving the reliability and interoperability of APIs could help prolong the life span of existing applications and services. By understanding how software producers operate and by incentivizing them to behave in a environmentally responsible manner, it may be possible to mitigate some negative impacts associated with technology development. The text discusses the various issues and challenges that are associated with the current state of mobile operating systems. It highlights the importance of developing more effective OSes that can be tailored to each individual device, while also ensuring that these systems are able to throttle and control usage in order to prolong device life. Overall, this is an important issue because it underscores the need for mobile devices to be recycled in a responsible way if they are going to have any hope of lasting beyond two or three years. The text discusses the issue of metal recycling and how it is not nearly as effective as it could be. Many high-tech functions rely on small metals, and this has led to a growing trend of promotional offers for users to recycle their devices. However, this practice has had a limited effect due to the low uptake rate among consumers and distributors. Meanwhile, environmental initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of electronic waste are also having an impact, with more people beginning to see recycling as a viable option for their old electronics. The main concern here is that these measures may reduce consumer confidence in recycled products, which could have a negative impact on future sales. In addition to encouraging changes in consumer behavior, the authority might also take steps to improve knowledge about recycling practices among end users and manufacturers alike. This would help ensure that recycled products are durable and easy to repair without requiring regular maintenance or software updates The text discusses several ways to reduce the incentive for users to renew their subscriptions to broadband services. One approach is to make it easier for new, innovative models of broadband distribution to emerge. Another is to encourage more responsible practices by service providers when using bandwidth-intensive applications, such as websites, video streaming services, and cloud storage. Finally, it is important to ensure that devices are designed "by design" with a sustainable digital footprint in mind. The text discusses the future of internet traffic and how it is expected to grow in both volume and diversity. Some key points that are made include: 
- The majority of internet traffic will come from CDN providers in 2022, as compared to 2017. This is due to the rapid growth of online content and services. 
- Netflix, Google, Amazon, and Facebook are among the most important CDN providers in terms of traffic volume. Their dominance on the market has led to increased congestion on networks across the globe. 
- France is not alone in this trend; more than half of all internet traffic entering France comes from four major CDN providers: Netflix, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. This concentration has led to network congestion becoming increasingly widespread throughout Europe. The text discusses the various ways in which technology can have an impact on the environment, and points out that one of the most significant ways in which technology impacts the environment is through its use of bandwidth. It discusses how some providers of internet services are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to reduce the environmental impact of their users’ online activities without compromising user experience. Several actions that could be taken by these providers to reduce their environmental impact without impacting user experience are discussed, including disabling auto-play videos, adjusting video resolution or quality based on screen size, and encouraging customers to adopt better online practices such as turning off autoplay and reducing screen brightness. The text also mentions a particular case study involving two large CDN providers – Netflix and YouTube – who have been criticized for their lack of action in reducing their environmental impact. However, given that they do not control content distribution or customer behavior, it seems likely that even if individual sites were to make significant efforts towards reducing their environmental impact, collective action would still be necessary in order to propagate those practices across millions of websites created each year. When it comes to the main services that should consider implementing tools to encourage more sustainable use of bandwidth, several causes have been cited, including incentives aimed at the largest bandwidth consumers, as well as measures designed to reduce the overall impact of large data flows on smaller actors. One proposal that is frequently mentioned is the imposition of a tax or tariff on those who generate the most data – in effect, targeting those with the greatest online footprint. This code of conduct would include good practices such as using storage and equipment located locally, and limiting consumption levels for those who consume a lot of data – essentially sending a price signal to providers of internet access services. In either case, Arcep – which has already begun carrying out some work on digital infrastructure and training for citizens in relation to technology – could be responsible for collecting revenue from these measures. Other parallel initiatives might also contribute financially to public sector efforts aimed at improving digital sustainability. The text discusses the various ways in which internet usage can have an impact on the environment, and provides recommendations for mitigating those impacts. One way to reduce environmental impact is through free cooling of data centers using evaporative cooling systems. This system uses air from outside the building to cool servers when it becomes too hot inside the building. The text also discusses other ways in which internet usage can have an impact, including energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of how internet usage can affect both the environment and individual users. In today’s world, it is possible to obtain a stable temperature throughout the year without having to reduce energy consumption by using cooling towers or air-conditioning systems. In fact, thanks to modern servers and cooling technologies, it is now possible to maintain an interior temperature even when air temperatures are very humid. This is done through the use of an adiabatic circuit that cools the servers with cold water drawn from outside sources (between 22°C and 30°C). Another way to reduce energy consumption in data centers is through the use of free cooling indirect methods, which use ambient air instead of refrigerating machines to cool servers. There are several types of free cooling methods available, all of which employ some form of refrigeration (adiabatic or mechanical) to keep servers cold. The most important aspect of this technology is that it can significantly reduce environmental impact by using less power than traditional air-conditioning systems. Positive practices that are currently being used by data centers seem to display legally-binding values around 1.5 for tangible opposables or aiming to achieve traditional cooling methods with a temperature reduction of 1.15198 degrees Celsius, compared to free cooling without adiabatic ice preservation. Other indicators indicating the need for more stringent environmental standards at European level, such as an energy efficiency level above 50%, appear to be decisive in order for the Arcep to assume responsibility for these codes. It appears that the design of data centers is primarily under control of economic actors, who must be persuaded through information gathering and understanding the current situation in order to identify key environmental issues affecting these actors and take appropriate action. This task may be easier said than done, as it will require significant effort on behalf of policymakers as well as industry players (operators, providers of services, etc.) to understand and adhere to environmentally-conscious practices. A regulatory framework that allows for information collection and assessment would play an important role in facilitating this process. The text discusses the importance of taking action to protect the environment and ensure public trust in technology. It discusses how data collection and analysis can help improve environmental awareness and make informed decisions about how to use technology. The text also points out that, beyond simply collecting data, it is also important to use this information in a way that encourages users to make responsible choices for their own well-being. This requires strategies such as providing clear and concise information about environmental impacts associated with digital technologies, ensuring legal safeguards are in place to protect user privacy, and working towards increased interoperability between different digital tools and services. The text discusses various ways in which the government could consider implementing a proactive approach to data governance, specifically focusing on the development of tools that would help consumers make informed decisions about their environmental impact. Several positive initiatives that are already available or could be enhanced with the deployment of existing tools are mentioned, such as "Openfoodfacts" and "Yuka." The government may also consider launching projects aimed at developing quality comparison tools and public awareness campaigns on environmental matters. If action is not taken, other tools may emerge to help regulate data by means of information. The Arcep is working to develop a "barometer" that will measure the environmental efforts of various actors in order to better understand and incentivize sustainable practices. The aim is to create a platform where all stakeholders can share information and collaborate on initiatives that will reduce the environmental impact of digital technologies. While acknowledging the potential benefits of digital usage, the Arcep believes that it is important to simultaneously address issues such as climate change and resource depletion. To do this, it recommends mobilizing resources through initiatives like carbon neutrality, while also encouraging innovation and creativity in technology development. Ultimately, the goal is to create an environment where both economic growth and environmental responsibility are achievable together. The text discusses the need for better regulation of the internet, specifically in terms of its environmental impact. The author suggests that the power to regulate this impact should be given to a public entity, in order to ensure that all relevant information is collected and analyzed. This data will then be used to make informed decisions about how best to manage the internet’s environmental impact. Additionally, the author urges policymakers to consider environmental impacts when making decisions about regulating telecom companies and other digital platforms. Finally, the author suggests implementing tax measures and other incentives designed to encourage sustainable behavior on part of digital platform providers and users. The text discusses a number of topics related to the environment, including initiatives taken by the ADEME with regards to creating a reference guide for environmental measurement. One main point made is that it is important to measure environmental issues in order to better understand them and provide information that can be used by users. Another key point made is that environmental impact should be considered when designing policies and incentives for telecommunications providers. Finally, the text discusses ways in which environmental impacts can be minimized in mobile networks. The digital world is constantly evolving, and so too must the ways in which we consume and produce resources. In order to ensure that the digital world remains sustainable, policymakers have developed codes of conduct for both users and providers of digital content. However, these codes of conduct are often ineffective due to a lack of enforcement mechanisms. To address this issue, policymakers are increasingly turning to measures that promote “regulation by data” – such as developing tools that help consumers make informed decisions about their consumption choices and their impact on the environment.

One such measure is publishing an “environmental barometer” that would track the best practices across all aspects of the digital ecosystem. Another proposal is “regulation by data” – which would involve imposing tariffs on those who abuse bandwidth or use excessive amounts of energy when online. While these proposals deserve further analysis, they illustrate just how important it is for policymakers to develop innovative strategies in order to sustainably manage our growing reliance on technology. The 2020 global digital overview reports on the state of digital technology and its impact on society. The report discusses how the transition to a more sustainable digital world is possible, and provides recommendations for policymakers. The Shift Project has released two reports on lean ICT and climate change, which provide insights into how to reduce data center energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. European Union lawmakers have passed a resolution calling for a single market for digital services that is more environmentally friendly. Scientists have developed metrics for assessing the sustainability of data centers, and Arcep has released a report on fiber optic networks. The following are key points and concepts related to the digital transformation of the internet:

Content Delivery Network (CDN): A platform that distributes content more efficiently for websites and applications by reducing the distance between clients and servers. Cloud Radio Access Network (Cloud RAN): An architecture for a centralized radio network accessed through virtualization technology and cloud computing platforms which can be deployed at large scale and collaboratively. Ecoconception: The concept of ecological design was first introduced in 2002 with ISO/TR 14062 standardization efforts focused on improving product sustainability The text discusses the concept of ecoconception, which is the integration of environmental aspects into product design and development. The first documented example of ecoconception was published in 1998 and was based on a now-abandoned French standard, FD X 30-310. The ADEME has played an important role in developing ecoconception as well as representing France at international levels. In 2009, the European Union defined ecoconsciousness as "the integration of environmental characteristics into product conception with the aim of improving energy performance throughout its life cycle." Edge computing refers to using smaller, more localized data centers instead of centralized "big" ones. This technology has been called the "rebound effect" because it often results in increased energy use rather than decreased consumption. W. Stanley Jevons first identified this paradox in 1865 when he observed that any technological innovation that would improve energy efficiency for an existing usage might actually lead to an increase in overall energy consumption due to rebound effects The introduction of the Watt machine led to an increase in coal consumption in England despite more efficient use of this fuel. This was due to the innovations of Watt, which made coal a more affordable energy source, leading to its widespread use within factories and thus increasing overall coal consumption. At the national level, emissions accounting does not take into account emissions from foreign sources. However, when considering global emissions and taking into account indirect emissions associated with energy production (scope 2), international comparisons can be made. The 2006 ISO 14064-1 standard defines principles and requirements for quantifying and reporting GHG emissions and their reduction. It includes requirements for design, development, management, reporting, verification of inventory of GHG emissions from an organization. Scope 1 refers to direct greenhouse gas emissions (from fixed or mobile installations located inside the organizational perimeter), while scope 3 covers indirect emission associated with imported electricity production, heat generation from thermal sources such as buildings or industrial processes not involving combustion (e.g., waste treatment plants), transportation costs incurred by employees moving between work sites or goods transported up and down supply chains etc… Greenhouse gas emission levels at an organization can be divided into two categories: direct greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1) and indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy production (scope 2). Other indirect emission categories exist as well (scope 3). A comprehensive definition of these scopes is provided by the ADEME: https://www.bilans-ges.ademe.fr/fr/accueil/contenu/index/page/bilan%2Bges%2Borganisation/siGras/1 Direct greenhouse gas emisions (or SCOPE 1) : Emissions directly produced by fixed or mobile installations located inside the organizational perimeter such as combustion from stationary sources or motor vehicles operated on site; industrial processes not involving combustion; flaring off gaseous substances generated during operations from landfills managed under organic law; agricultural fertilization using nitrogenous compounds derived from animal manure; The text discusses the various environmental impacts of digital products and services. It covers emissions from both domestic and international sources, as well as the impact of digital technologies on the environment in general. The main points covered include: 

-The environmental impact of digital products and services is significant, covering emissions from both domestic and international sources. 
-Digital technologies have a negative impact on the environment, particularly when it comes to climate change. The digital world is having a significant impact on the environment, with consequences that are still being felt today. The term "environmental impact" refers to the effect that digital technology has on the environment, and does not necessarily refer to concepts like "carbon footprint" or "emissions from electronic devices." Rather, it refers simply to the influence of digital technology on the environment. In terms of intensity of carbon dioxide emissions, internet-connected objects (IoT) rank as one of the most polluting industries: they produce more CO2 than traditional businesses such as manufacturing or transportation. One way to measure an object's energy efficiency is by its power usage effectiveness (PUE), which measures how much energy a given data center consumes relative to what would be necessary for running its hardware. Finally, access networks are essential for connecting people and devices to each other over a network; in this context, they refer specifically to fixed broadband networks (such as DSL or cable) and mobile networks (such as LTE). The network of collection refers to the part of an infrastructure network, at the upstream end of the network and responsible for transporting signals between the network backbone and access networks. Network backbone (or core network): The core network represents the main part of an infrastructure network, characterized by a high bandwidth, which concentrates signals from other parts of the network and transports them between them or to other networks. Telephone switched telephone service (TSPS) : The TSPS is the historical technology for fixed telephone service (telephone hooked up directly to a telephone outlet). Resources abiotic: The adjective abiotic means "without life." Resources abiotic refer to elements such as water, rare earths, fossil fuels such as oil or coal, in general in limited quantities. Small cells: Small cells or mobile sites are "mini-sites" with low power and short range (about 100 meters). System operating system (OS): An operating system is a set of programs that allows you to control and manage computer resources. More simply put, it's an ensemble of programs that enables you to operate and control a computer device. inspiration : In addition to two presentations on cyber security risks and environmental impacts related thereto delivered by experts from Atelier Partenaire Specialiste ANSSI - Risk Cyber Environment on 25 November 2020 online workshop entitled "Risk Cyber Environment", inspired by two interventions delivered earlier this year - one on risk cyber environment on 25 November 2020 themed "Inspiration" led by Camille Dubedout doctoral candidate at L'Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale's Division Management Security Technologies & Innovation; another on risk environnemental cyber environment presented at ANSSI's Workshop Cybersecurity Risks & Environmental Impacts organized in collaboration with Atelier Partenaire Specialiste des Risques Cybersécurité Environnemental le 25 novembre 2020 This workshop aimed to explore the connections between cybersecurity and environment, for the first time, and provide a foundation of shared knowledge among participants. The first session focused on offering a common understanding of risk, while the second session explored potential synergies between cybersecurity and environmental efforts. Participants were then asked to identify challenges facing both public and private sectors in achieving cyber resilience by 2025. Finally, each group was asked to come up with concrete solutions to address these challenges.

The main points that emerged from this workshop include: 
-Both cybersecurity and environmental concerns share many commonalities, making cooperation between these two domains possible; 
-There is growing interest among stakeholders in pursuing cyber resilience through innovative systems design and data management strategies; 
-Stakeholders must work together to develop solutions that are effective across multiple dimensions (political, economic, social). The text discusses the importance of cybersecurity and digital trust in the present day, and identifies three key challenges that must be addressed if society is to maintain its digital infrastructure: risk management, sustainable development, and convincing decision-makers that a lack of effort on the part of government officials towards cyberspace security will have long-term consequences. In addition to these overarching concerns, specific risks associated with cyberattacks were also discussed, including environmental damage caused by data breaches and economic impacts stemming from lost business due to online attacks. The workshop participants were then asked to project what 2025 might look like for cybersecurity and digital trust, based on current trends and predictions. This exercise yielded three main scenarios: one in which cyberthreats become increasingly widespread; another in which critical ecosystem balances are threatened by technology advances; and a third in which society is unable to adequately respond to major cyberincidents. The workshop participants were then divided into groups tasked with coming up with concepts or principles that could help guide future action on cybersecurity issues. Some of these concepts included risk assessment, cross-sector collaboration, education for all stakeholders, effective response strategies when crises do occur, as well as public awareness campaigns designed to build public confidence in online systems. Overall, this event was an important step forward in understanding the challenges facing society as it moves forward into the era of digital trust The cybersecurity challenge is often seen as a global issue, affecting everything from the physical world to the environment. In both cases, the consequences are often local in nature. The task of assessing cybersecurity risks and protecting ecosystems is complex and logical, but fraught with redundancy of data across different purposes. Efforts must be made to share data accurately in order to regulate by data. Beyond that, there is an overarching goal of transitioning to a digital economy that is sustainable and protects user data while minimizing energy consumption and carbon emissions. Cybersecurity measures must be aligned with these broader goals if they are to have lasting impact. Finally, it is important to consider synergies between cybersecurity and environmental efforts in order to create viable solutions that meet both objectives simultaneously. While this may seem like an ambitious goal at first glance, it is worth considering if we are truly committed to preserving our digital infrastructure for future generations. The text discusses the importance of cyber security and how it can be used to protect businesses from various risks, including environmental ones. Several specific challenges related to cyber security are outlined, along with potential solutions. Finally, ways in which cyber security should be integrated into a company's overall sustainability strategy are discussed. The following text discusses the challenges posed by cybersecurity and environmentalism, and offers suggestions on how to address them. One key suggestion is that we should develop a concept of "sustainable by design" (durable through design) that would unite different concepts related to cybersecurity, privacy, and environmentalism. This would require solutions that are managed with a high level of sustainability in mind.
