In 2019, for the first time in France, smartphones surpassed computer ownership rates. 
- As a result, the uncontrolled growth of digital usage has led to environmental impacts that are becoming increasingly apparent- 44% of French people consider the internet as a threat to the environment. 
- In practice, digital usage is responsible for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
- The increase in smartphone use has left us with no choice but to confront this environmental impact head on- especially when it comes to health concerns caused by sudden work intensification and online shopping exploding. 
- This issue is only starting to be addressed in territorial development strategies. Transportation related pollution is still vastly different from that generated by digital usage. 
- The opportunity offered by digital technology to reduce our environmental footprint relative to professional travel or document paperlessness must be weighed against its benefits and costs. 77% of French people aged 12 or older are using smartphones with emissions above EU6 levels in 2020. 
-This is the first time that the percentage of smartphones with emissions above EU6 levels exceeds 8%. 
-Since 2010, employment growth in the digital sector has been driven by the economic sector in Nantes metropolitan area. 
-8 datacenters have been identified in Nantes metropolitan area by 2020. Beyond pure data providers, the territory also hosts important internal servers for large companies and national government agencies (e.g., National Criminal Record, CHU, University...). The document discusses the environmental impacts of digital consumption, focusing on energy consumption in production and use of electronic equipment.
-Two main topics are covered: the production of electronic equipment, with a focus on smartphones and other digital devices, and electric energy consumption.
-The impact of digital consumption is also considered based on the type of energy production (nuclear, coal, hydroelectric…). This information leads to estimates for electricity consumption in all places where our online activities take place. The document discusses ways to balance electricity production and consumption, noting the different impacts on the environment depending on the time of day. 
-Technological and temporal aspects of electricity production lead to differences in carbon emissions for digital uses. Locally appropriating global consumption related to digital uses: a futile effort? In terms of "digital consumption", each individual user-administered-internationally dispersed citizen mobilizes resources currently throughout the world. Reducing local impact of digital uses would consist of relocating various events occurring naturally at an international scale. VOD video demand (i.e., watching videos when requested) is an excellent example of an event with high energy consumption but geographically dispersed across the globe. While 36% of French adults over 12 years old are subscribed to a video service in France in 20194, how can we reduce consumption? 
-Compared to other sources of pollution, GES emissions from digital energy use are relatively low. However, rapid increases in digital usage require our attention. A drop in water's surface level Le numérique est responsable de 4 à 6 % des émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GES) sur l’ensemble du monde. 
-Ces émissions sont 10 fois moins importantes que les consommations liées aux déplacements. 
-Le développement des usages énergétiques plus efficaces induit une augmentation de la pollution précédente génération. 
-D’ici 2040, le numérique pourrait être responsable de 8 % des émissions de GES en France. The actuel de l’industrie manufacturière is 13%. 
-Usage follows a uncontrolled growth. 
-Consumption of data in 4G increases at a rate of 30% each year. 
-In this context, energy efficiency innovations will not be able to compensate for the uncontrolled increase in our consumption. There are then only digital tools for reducing consumption and producing renewable energies. 
-The distribution of CO emissions related to the share of digital activities in global emissions is as follows: 
-Energy consumption on Nantes Metropolitan Area is 8%. 
-Scenario without sobriété has 49% chance of happening by 2025. 
-Industry uses 28% of total CO emissions by 2025 under scenario without sobriété, while it would use 7% with sobriety. Les auteurs de l’étude soulignent que les solutions « smart » ne réduiront pas la crise climatique et énergétique, au contraire.
-Les pratiques en cours dans le département de Loire-Atlantique visent à optimiser son infrastructure numérique afin de limiter l’impact lié à la fabrication des terminaux. Urgency and under pressure of the health crisis, distance classes made their breakthrough in spring 2020. But taking environmental impact into account in equipment acquisitions remains sparse for administrations. With confinement, the question has arisen for departments to equip all high school students with tablets to limit student dropout rates. The department of Loire-Atlantique decided to equip only disadvantaged high school students because it was not necessary to equip already equipped households. A decision taken in an emergency context and guided by budgetary and environmental factors. For further progress, the community has been working on optimization of its information infrastructure for over a year incorporating environmental criteria into public procurement processes and making for example the acquisition of equipment made from recycled plastic. Managing obesity in digital services Public services have been increasingly digitized over the past decade, generating a growing need for data storage. New services involving data analysis, such as open data initiatives, are also contributing to this increase. As a result: More “data warehouses” are being built; And garbage dumps filled with “urban data” are growing rapidly. The term “obesity digital” has a whole new meaning here. This is the new challenge faced by systems information directors at municipalities. In department of Loire-Atlantique, personal data processing—especially related to health—has been increasing for several years now. The desire to keep these sensitive information locally creates tension on offer of data hosting services Le Département souhaite continuer à évoluer le service public tout en maitrisant, voire en réduisant les besoins de stockage. 
- La journée du nettoyage numérique est lancée en 2021 auprès de ses 5 000 agents. 
- Le triptyque « Éviter, compenser, réduire » risque fort d’être imposé aux projets numériques dans les marchés publics. The document discusses the role of local governments in the digital age, and how they can help to sensitize citizens and professionals about the impact of their digital usage. 
- Individuals are the first users of digital technology, with smartphone ownership reaching a new high in 2019. 
- The French legislature has required broadband providers and mobile carriers to report their carbon footprints starting in 2022. 
- Local initiatives to promote circular economy practices exist already. BackMarket, a new French ecommerce giant, is positioning itself on the market for recycled goods. More locally, Nâga (Rezé), an association focused on data recovery, has recovered entire computer systems or individual computers from private individuals. The document discusses ways in which digital actors can be more environmentally responsible.
-Some of the actors involved in the digital sphere are asked to compensate for the negative impacts they create.
-The document also mentions that local governments have a role to play in this area by providing assistance with energy efficiency, sharing resources, or making smarter city planning decisions.
-A majority of participants (61%) think that a municipality taking proactive measures to reduce environmental impacts would be a good thing. 31% des usages du numérique se font en urgence 
- 5% de l’impact environnemental du numérique est lié aux autres enjeux environnementaux
- Les échelles européenne et nationale abritent les principaux leviers de changement pour la politique publique locale sur le numérique
- Une analyse avantage-coût pour le territoire semble évidente, mais il faut aller plus loin que une simple course à l’innovation The stakes are high: avoiding getting stuck in technology hellholes like we're currently trapped in an urban structured around the car. It's not about rejecting technology, but more about not having blind faith in its benefits and taking into account its costs. Environmental evaluation of digital projects is thus central. The installation of a dedicated methodology for "smart" projects is the only recommendation singled out clearly by the Senate's information commission in their report released in June 2020. The last publication from think tank "The Shift Project", communicated in October 2020, also tackles this issue by proposing a method for analyzing the energy relevance of digital projects on territorial grounds. Everything still needs to be done here: comparative analysis of alternative solutions, definition of environmental indicators or even life cycle assessment. 

-Experimentation is key to integrating environmental evaluation systematically, testing new solutions in each policy field during implementation. On the territory of Nantes Metropolitan Area, Nantes City Lab offers project developers the opportunity to experiment with their large-scale solutions within city limits. A systematic evaluation of projects would determine whether a tested solution has potential benefits compared to its environmental impacts. Technological choices will condition our future means of action 

Technology can create dependency and reduce public agency's maneuverability when it comes to energy transition Ses multiples délégataires, prestataires ou fournisseurs intervient dans des champs multiples de la vie quotidienne : transports, logement, enseignement ou encore aménagement de l’espace public.
- Elle dispose d’une expertise en maîtrise d’ouvrage, garante de l’intérêt général et du bien commun.
- Aussi, si le numérique demande aux services une véritable montée en compétences, la collectivité doit continuer de s’appuyer sur ce savoir-faire fondamental : affirmer les objectifs, gérer les délégataires et évaluer l’action territoriale au regard des enjeux majeurs de transformation de la société. "Les outils numériques dans les politiques publiques locales."
- "La contrainte à l’échelle locale n’est pas perçue comme une solution efficace à court terme face à des usages dont les effets sont largement extérieurs au bassin de vie de chacun."
- "D’autres orientations publiques sont aujourd’hui privilégiées, mais qu’en sera-t-il demain ?"
- "En 2021, l’enjeu de l’illectronisme concerne 1 Français sur 7 : 13 millions de Français se disent éloignés du numérique."
-"Ils utilisent peu, voire pas du tout, Internet et se sentent en difficulté face à l’affirmation du numérique comme un outil indispensable dans la vie quotidienne."
-"Le levier à ce stade est de faire preuve de pédagogie pour sensibiliser les usagers en même temps que de les former."
-"Les actions de médiation numérique qui œuvrent en ce sens vont être amenées à s’étoir avec la mise en œuvre du volet inclusion numérique du Plan Pauvretée de l’État."
-"Sensibilisation est-elle un levier suffisant ?" Sensibilisation is today privileged, will enough contain the growth of digital impact? Nearly three-quarters of French people would accept a tariff increase to reduce their computer’s electricity consumption or make it easier to recycle equipment. Among these, 80% are also willing to moderate their digital practices6. Practices that fit into the context of a perpetual evolution of online offer, which in turn are themselves driven by this evolution. 
-There is currently no easy way for someone with little or no knowledge about how digital devices work and information technology tools to use them. 565 hectares on average are artificially created each year between 2009 and 2017. 
-It is crucial that territorial data on energy consumption be available in order to understand the implications of online uses. However, data on electronic energy consumption does not currently include issues related to online usage. To what extent can territorially based initiatives take back control over desirable online uses? The first step in achieving this goal is understanding where we start. A diagnosis is necessary before setting an ambition. The availability of local information on digital device usage is essential. However, current data on energy consumption does not reflect the scale of our electronic usage. What kind of information should be made available at territorial level in order to achieve an understanding of the impacts of digital devices? The document discusses how to produce a cartography of places where electronic waste is stored and mobilized resources, as well as estimating the volume of electronic equipment and terminals in residents' homes and businesses. 
-At a more operational level, the first lever for municipalities concerned with managing electronic equipment and usage is internal structures and networks dedicated to this purpose. There are such structures and networks available, for example ADN Ouest. In the short term, on a wider field than management of internal usage, immediate urgency is needed for: 
-developing territorial strategies specifically designed to manage our digital media usage (local data center clusters, recycling networks...), 
-finding a place in the agenda of environmental impacts of our digital media usage compared to current practices, 
-evaluating more systematically the environmental impact of digital solutions in comparison to current practices, 
-building a methodology for locally deploying evaluation of environmental impacts, 
-maintaining or even strengthening actions aimed at sensitizing citizens and users of Loire Atlantique about digital media. If compulsion is not an urgent issue at present, it might be in the future. Especially in Nantes—a city with efforts underway to reduce emissions from other sources (traveling, housing...). The document is a report on the 2020 transition to an ecological digital world.
