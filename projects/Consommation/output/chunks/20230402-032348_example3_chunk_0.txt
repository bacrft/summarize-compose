The "digital revolution" is causing an energy-hungry trend.
-The increase in electronic equipment and devices is fueling concerns about energy consumption.
-There are still many questions about how the digital revolution will impact energy consumption.
-It's important to consider the environmental impacts of the digital age, as well as other consumer behaviors influenced by technology. 
-"Green" promises for a more sustainable digital era are still unproven. 
-We need to take into account all of the other pressures technology imposes on the environment, especially when we're talking about electronics recycling. The digital revolution is considered a "revolution in digital usage", with new uses of data in all private and professional sectors, exchanged via networks such as the Internet. This necessitates equipment in three main categories: terminals in contact with users: computers, tablets, smartphones, screens, connected objects, box decoders for TV; servers and storage devices of organizations providing or using digital services (large web companies, banks, government agencies...), sometimes grouped together in vast data centers.
- The infrastructure for transmitting digital data networks (transmitters-relays, cables, fibers, distributors, etc.) is also growing rapidly. Some key statistics provide an idea of the evolution of the digital world. The proportion of Internet users has increased from less than 10% of the global population in 2000 to 35% in 2012. The volume of data exchanged annually has more than doubled every year until 2002 and continues to grow at a sustained rate1. The percentage of smartphone owners has quadrupled in France over five years to reach 65% in 2016. More than 80% of French people have at least one computer and 40% have a tablet at home. In work environments there is also a trend towards using technology. A recent audit conducted by 50 organizations (both small businesses and large enterprises) revealed that on average each organization had ten computers and three printers2 Wi-Fi et un autre équipement numérique pour dix salariés, ainsi que près de trois serveurs informatiques pour 100 salariés :
- Cette révolution numérique est souvent présentée comme une des grandes transformations sociétales en cours.
- Pour certains, elle pourrait accompagner et favoriser la transition énergétique en développant des outils et solutions permettant d’optimiser les services et systèmes énergétiques.
- Pour d’autres, elle est le symbole d’une société toujours plus avide d’énergie, en proie à l’ébriété énergétique. "estime en 2015 à 22 TWh/an la consommation d’électricité des équipements informatiques et audiovisuels dans les logements, et à 26 TWh/an celle des usages informatiques et numériques dans le tertiaire (incluant à la fois les appareils terminaux et les serveurs)5."
- "Une cartographie répertoriait 156 data centers en France en 20166."
- "On ne connaît pas dans le détail le nombre et le type d’appareils qu’ils abritent, mais une étude prospective a estimé leur consommation électrique à environ 6 TWh/an en 2015 : la moitié pour les appareils, l’autre pour les périphériques et la climatisation7."
-"RTE table lui sur une consommation deux fois moindre5." Les infrastructures des réseaux et télécommunications représentent 3,5 TWh/an de consommation d'électricité en France métropolitaine. 
- La moitié de cette consommation est pour les appareils terminaux domestiques, l’autre pour les appareils terminaux professionnels (hors serveurs). Les serveurs et data centers mobilisent 5 TWh/an. Les infrastructures de réseaux représentent 0,7 TWh/an. 
- Ces chiffres sont comparables à une estimation faite pour l'Allemagne en 2012, qui estimait la consommation totale des réseaux et télécommunications à 6 TWh/an. "l'énergie grise" refers to the energy consumed by electronic devices, as well as the energy used to produce and extract materials that make up these devices, called "energy gray." 
- It is difficult to estimate, because it depends on a number of factors and assumptions about activities located mostly in Asia. 
- Cycle life analyses have been done on some devices, but with variable results. 
- The cited numbers here are only approximations, due to lack of comparable studies on the subject. 
- The levels of energy gray found in European efficiency regulations for products range from 5% to 50% of the device's operating energy consumption. 
- For smartphones (which are economical in electricity and have short lifespans), energy gray can represent five times more than what the device will use over its lifespan. Inventories of all French metropolitan area equipment were calculated using this information, resulting in an overall energy gray cumulative amount representing around 15% of total power usage previously estimated. But there are still a number of small auxiliary equipment not accounted for (cables, peripheral computer equipment, chargers, gadgets, etc.), leading one to think that we may be even closer to 20%. If we consider carbon accounting calculations instead, the weight of product manufacturing becomes even greater due to its location almost exclusively in China where electricity is still a major emitter of greenhouse gases. The impact of the manufacturing process on environmentalism is becoming increasingly important as more efficient and mobile devices are created. This justifies giving it all the attention necessary, and making greater efforts than today to make electronic devices more durable, repairable, reusable, and recyclable.

-What is certain is that by 2020, there will be 50 billion objects connected in the world. This is due in part to the ever-growing size of attachments on our emails and the finer definition of videos online. In addition, Big Data will be used increasingly for activities such as "streaming" large amounts of data.

-New data centers are becoming even more extravagant: For example, operator OVH has built a 20,000 square meter data center in Gravelines France to house several hundred thousand servers. 

-Along with this increase in connected objects will come an increase in energy consumption due to increased usage of "smart" buildings and systems that are ubiquitous now. Some studies predict that by 2020 there will be 50 billion smart objects in the world. The document mentions a astronomical number of 200 people over the long term! However, one should be careful when generalizing: if there is an interest in these objects shown in these investigations, it is not widespread.
-Moreover, some of these devices can work without electricity. For example, some small devices can work with solar or ambient energy (body heat, kinetic energy), as this is starting to happen. 
-This article comes from decrypterlenergie.org and it discusses the energy issue called gluttony.
-First of all, one has to take into account that time is not infinite and that saturation and substitution are beginning to be noticeable in digital consumption habits. For example, sales of desktop computers have been declining for several years now because we replace them with portable ones (less energy-intensive) and we use them less because smartphones (still less energy-intensive) are taking over. 
-Furthermore, a certain number of current devices will become obsolete due to the miniaturization of digital media and the increase in available networks. Readers of DVD players, gaming consoles, office PCs will probably become rarer as more lightweight terminals get information from servers instead. The trend towards nomadism will also favor devices that operate on battery power intrinsically more economical. Finally, technological advances allow all devices to become more efficient in terms of energy use The document discusses the progress that is being made, and it even intensifies with stricter regulations at European levels. 
-The need for climate control in data centers will also be reduced thanks to better design of facilities and the reuse of heat generated by nearby buildings. How far are these advances possible? For example, Greentouch, a consortium of professionals who have worked on future digital networks, has announced potentials that are quite spectacular: it is possible to reduce electricity consumption by 98% in ten years19. A quantitative estimation can be made of which trends will prevail. It is possible to make assumptions about future trends for different positions, then calculate energy consumption results as a result of those assumptions. We did this calculation for France, assuming a very strong development in digital uses. Assumptions Trends Past Evolution on Energy Consumption Justification Source 2010-2015 2015-2030 Electricity Consumption +10%/year Increase in network capacities and new generations of networks (+5-10%); infrastructure investments totaling €11 billion ($13 billion) over the next 15 years (+8%) Number of servers and +6%/year on average (tripling within 15 additional data centers by 2030) Power per server and De better technologies and installation arrangements for data centers already in place -3% to -10% The document discusses the potential for energy savings of 40% or more with par an.
-The 20 and 10 (appliances and according to different appliances, we assume they will be largely in place by 2030. climate control of locales) Institutions of energy monitoring have already seen a rise in sales 
-The average computer +3% annually +2% annually (Gartner, MMA…)
-Consumption is shifting towards portable devices and there are steady gains in average time spent using devices -7% annually -7% annually on average
-There will be continued significant advances in technologies such as laptops +8% yearly on average and tablets becoming more common (GfK, recently) 
-Consumption is rising steadily across all device types (but tablets are growing the fastest at 63 million units recently) 
-The number of monitors for computers is decreasing while the number of laptop screens will decrease over time The document discusses the potential for energy consumption from digital devices in 2030.
- The document predicts that there will be an increase in electric power consumption from digital devices by 25% in 2030, or 3% of the national current electricity consumption. This is not a dramatic increase, but it is still necessary to continue efforts to be more efficient with our energy use.
- This prediction is consistent with RTE's projection of a very modest increase in energy consumption from technologies related to information and communication over the next five years. The digital revolution is likely to bring an energy demand increase in other sectors.
-The digital has infiltrated all economic sectors and theoretically has the ability to sustain wasteful energy consumption behaviors like promoting more sustainable consumption behaviors.
-It is clear that so far, transportation sector growth is mainly supported by digital technologies (like the ability to have anything delivered from anywhere else in the world with a click of a button). 
-The digital industry often points to its supposed ability to save energy in a systemic way. However, studies and prospectives on this topic are usually theoretical, insufficiently systemized4 and unaware of rebound effects24. 
-For example, if one looks at potential changes suggested by a 2009 study commissioned by large companies (representing about 110 TWh/an of cumulative primary energy savings25), it becomes apparent that most of them have not been realized (for example, widespread implementation of urban tolls, massive development of smart homes technology, benefits of video conferencing). It seems risky therefore to assert that occasional benefits observed on pilot or case projects can be generalized and lead tosystematic reductions in national energy consumption. The digital revolution will undoubtedly bring an important need for electrical equipment in our country, coupled with The document discusses the issue of electric consumption.

But the progress made in energy efficiency should be able to avoid an explosion in demand for electricity.

For this to happen, manufacturers and operators of the electrical sector should systematically use the most economical technologies, and priority should be given to digital uses that promote energy transition. Public policies and regulations should be intensified and updated regularly in order to follow rapidly changing industry trends and the appearance of new equipment. Consumers of electronic services, we all are, have an important role to play as well. More responsible and sober behavior is possible by avoiding unnecessary data flows: managing email usage wisely, controlling files sensibly, turning off devices when not needed... but also not buying constantly the latest gadget! The concept of digital sobriety becomes increasingly important as current trends continue27. Beyond electric consumption, it is also necessary to think about all other environmental damages caused by electronic equipment manufacture and disposal: depletion of materials, various pollution levels, etc. The road towards a "green" digital world takes a long time yet.
