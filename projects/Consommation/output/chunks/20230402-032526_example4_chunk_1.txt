- "levier essentiel pour la tran- sion sur l’empreinte environnementale" = an important factor in moving forward with reducing environmental impact The digital is a powerful collective force that is driving the evolution of society, both economically and socially, as well as in the regulation of tomorrow's everyday life of our citizens and in the evolution of public services.
- In this light, the Authority is attentive to ensuring that users of networks and services regulated by it follow the mode of action laid down in its Strategy for Digital Regulation, which sets out how they remain masters of their choices and can benefit from contributions from regulation through dialoguing with stakeholders.
- First, Covid-19 published in 2019 a note on "The Mental Dimension of Digital Transformation Is Not Necessarily Bound to Carbon Footprint14" in which it called on actors to combine technologies. The whole issue is to develop digital development in line with society's needs and requirements while taking into account environmental impacts.
- To achieve this goal, the Authority has decided to increase its power and launched a new requirement for work: "For A Sustainable Digital Economy." This approach integrates a wide range of actors despite social distancing and the current regulatory crisis. First, Covid-19 focused on opening up competition, then on developing its own capacities while being accompanied by an open attitude. The document discusses the importance of a sustainable digital economy and provides a overview of the different workshops held on the platform. 
-The main points of discussion at the workshops were related to cyber/environmental risks in electronic communications, as well as expanding on topics specific to France's digital future. 
-Five topical workshop themes were initially proposed, with online forum participation in order to keep discussions alive beyond the workshops themselves: 
-Adapting commercial practices for a sustainable digital economy; 
-Laying traps for obsolescence in order to preserve our digital heritage; 
-Defining our networks for a sustainable digital future; 
-Designing services and content that are both sustainable and scalable; and 
-Considering how we can shape our networks for an inclusive and prosperous digital future. A method to measure the environmental impact of digital footprints in the process of construction is being developed. 
- A coordinated approach must be taken in order to ensure a quality sustainable ecosystem for the digital world. The document discusses the environmental impacts of different technologies.
-The document encourages the transition from fixed networks to fibre optic networks.
-The document clarifies the issues related to mobile networks.
-The document urges action at European and international levels.
-To further reduce the environmental impact of digital data, more in depth studies are needed and a methodology for analysis needs to be developed. The document discusses the growth of digital devices in French households and how that growth is being driven by businesses (such as) as a source of this growth.
- Devices like televisions and computer monitors account for around 90% of all connected devices in French homes, while smartphones account for around 50%. 
- Lower levels of digital content consumption are limiting the potential growth of digital devices in France.

-"The Shift Project31 states that between 2011 and 2016 there were 10 doublés in terms of number of hours viewed as HD videos; it is estimated to triple over the 2017-2022 period." The Shift Project believes that today 3 to 4 percent of world production is generated by digital media. 
-"GreenIT.fr presents a similar order of magnitude concerning global emissions from media according to their study."" Citizing estimates the carbon footprint attributable to digital media at 4.61 percent The document estimates that by 2040, the environmental impact of digital consumption will be 6.7% of national carbon emissions.
-The document discusses ways to reduce digital consumption's environmental impact. 
-According to the Senate, this does not mean that telecommunications operators are responsible for all of the emissions from their networks - there are also networks connecting customers' final destinations (local), networks connecting providers (provider), and international networks.
-Digital consumption emits greenhouse gases in different ways depending on the network segments considered: communications networks connecting customers' final destinations (local), providers' communications networks, and international communication networks. According to the Senate, this does not mean that operators of part

Plus le téléviseur est grand, plus l’empreinte carbone associée est importante. - Les centres de données représentent également une source d’em-réseaux puisque les box qu’ils distri- prennent substantielle du trafic internet The study found that 10% of all energy consumption in 2018 was done through fixed networks -fixed networks seem to be growing their electricity consumption by 6% between 2010 and 2018 while mobile networks only grew by 2%. 
-This may be because improvements made to centers of data storage within fixed networks are more likely to have an impact on future energy consumption than mobile networks. The study found that "75% of resources consumed, publics have to take cognizance of environmental issues" and that 83% of consumptions in water are due to the sector.
- To enable an effective governance, it is necessary to provide good incentives for economic actors and users. This requires sixty different metals which only a handful are recyclable, as well as comprehensive chiffrage so that beneficiaries can benefit from harmonized methods for data analysis and collection management.
- It is also necessary to develop standardized processes for environmental assessment and evaluation so that stakeholders can have a holistic view of their digital footprint. The size of the impact is particularly apparent with regards to carbon dioxide emissions. 
-Both studies conclude that it is necessary to develop a more logical methodology in order to accurately estimate emissions. 
-One study, Citizing, covers a wider area (including consideration of production phases for digital networks and data centers) while the CGE focuses on recent growth trends in online activity. 
-Despite similar findings, both studies argue that there are still obstacles to overcome in order to implement an accurate estimation process. The document discusses an environmental technology that could improve energy efficiency in a product's life cycle, and which theoretically should involve services.
-For example, a reduction in energy usage effectiveness (PUE)68, which is a measure of an entity's overall energy consumption efficiency, would be one result of this technology.
-W. Stanley Jevons observed in 1865 that the introduction of the steam engine led to an increase in coal consumption even though its use was more efficient than before. This is called the "Jevons paradox."
-Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes developed the "postulate of Khazzoom-Brookes" in 1992, which states that any technological innovation that improves energy efficiency will also lead to increased total energy consumption. The document discusses the need for more accessible data to study the environmental impact of digital technologies. 
-A model that is general but applicable could help with this. The document discusses the importance of international cooperation in order to improve the discussion and decision-making process when it comes to environmental issues.
-Dialogue and sharing of good practices between different experts is needed in order to develop internationally recognized methodologies.
-Several positive initiatives are already underway in this direction. A society that can open up to us is essential for this work.
-The integration of UIT-T into these studies, as a commission called SG5 «Experience between actors», is essential.
-The results of the study are expected by the end of 2021.
-As previously mentioned, in response to climate change, 
-The regulation of electronic networks has become an important issue for development (ODD). Furthermore, the Arcep has initiated a reflection on and co-chairs these studies. SG5 considers «sustainability» as one of its working groups and has published guidelines on 2020.
-In France, l’ADEME also supports a research project on Ecocatalysts78 which aims at developing a framework for assessing environmental impacts from information technologies based on an approach to communication (ITU recommendation 140072) and in 2019 criteria for eco-conceptualization79 . French researchers are also involved in this consortium's work under the umbrella of EITRAP80 . The European Commission is trying to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050 by engaging different stakeholders involved with digital technology and environment. 
- In order to better understand and appreciate the environmental impact of digital technology, l’Arcep has desired to enrich its work with contributions from participants in the workplace employment program. 
- By way of bilateral meetings with engaged experts on the topic, but also by way of widening debates and gathering more voices than ever before through developing a space for dialogue within the collaborative platform “For a Sustainable Digital Future” (2.1), l’Arcep hopes to achieve its objectives. The Arcep has identified five topics for its work on sustainable digital usage: adapting commercial practices, reducing obsolescence, protecting personal data, ensuring neutrality of the internet, and improving quality of environment in digital space.
-The workshop participants identified priorities for addressing environmental impacts of digital use, including issues surrounding obsolescence and sustainability.
-Ouishare provided two online forums to facilitate discussion among workshop participants from different countries: one in September and another in November.
-The synchronous time frames of the meetings allowed for a deeper reflection on fundamental issues. The goal of the workshop was to provide mutual enrichment among the participants. 
- The discussions were constructive and respectful from the beginning. 
- Each participant was allowed to present themselves as a professional within their organization, without necessarily representing their organization's position. 
- On the online platform "For a Sustainable Digital Economy" (numeriquesoutenable.arcep.fr), which Arcep had created in advance, participants could find summaries of past workshops and access documents about service providers, mobile operators, preparatory meetings for upcoming workshops with distributors of terminals, users… The participants at the ARCEP wanted to provide everyone an opportunity to share their thoughts on the digital sustainable platform. 
-They asked participants to elaborate on why certain commercial practices led to a decrease in device lifespan and an increase in quantity of devices. 
-Sensitivities ranged from prohibiting such practices outright to proposing incentive mechanisms for sellers of devices (for example, collection of “good practices”). 
-Transparancy and improved user information were also mentioned as supplementary necessary tools for ensuring that users retain a critical perspective on technology development. 
-The ethical approach must be virtuous according to participants. The document discusses extensively the issue of terminal obsolescence.
-Participants in subgroups discussed more transversally, some actors expressing their views on the question: «What networks have been carrying the interrogation about possible privileging when one is situated at home with obsolescence of networks?»
-The internet of things (IoT) was also mentioned as an environmental factor?
-Discussions on an important topic, with effects on individual cases or limits, led to three main points.
-Proposals were asked for concerning user awareness messages or this workshop took part in Industry's logic.
-Debates started with first measures put into practice based on the initial assumption that wireline broadband should be preferred over WiFi; it was argued that reducing consumer's footprint would be more economical than mobile networks; and that having ecologically responsible professionals involved in product conception would make a big difference.
-Some actors did not play the same role and had different concerns about certain innovations, such as fixed vs mobile devices. The document discusses the environmental impact of mobile technologies. 
-Some factors to consider when making this decision include economic and merit considerations. 
-Renewed equipment that offers wireless connectivity is being discussed as a way to increase the environmental impact. 
-Tools that would help reduce technology use in an energy efficient manner are being discussed, such as automatic and energy saving technologies, especially at the box level. 
-The role of manufacturers and systems administrators is important in deciding whether or not mobile technologies should be switched off old 2G and/or 3G technologies for energy efficiency reasons. The document discusses the extinction of 2G and 3G networks, and identifies which practical material reasons there are for some actors to still use them.
-The participants also noted the importance of including a phase of network production in environmental assessment - which must go beyond just asking about an object's environmental impact because it should also consider how that object will create emissions.
-They emphasized the need for an arbitrage on the development of certain uses or, at least, optimizing services in order to minimize their environmental impact. The document discusses ways to reduce traffic on networks and improve the sustainability of economies. 
-Specific proposals were discussed, including developing a more sustainable economy and reducing data passing through networks. 
-Participants noted that fine knowledge of network coverage and traffic usage is needed in order to effectively use proposals discussed. 
-Leverages discussed need to be mutuallyized carefully depending on their respective impacts. Réseaux : négatifs qu'ils peuvent avoir sur d'autres la mise en veille des réseaux ? aspects importants du fonctionnement des réseaux, comme la qualité du service vice, la durée de vie des équipements de ce dernier atelier, l'Arcep a souhaité (sur ces deux premiers aspects, la mise en veille animer , dans une optique plus pédagogique) ou le maintien d'une concurrence bénéfique entre experts et non-experts sur les pour l'utilisateur final (sur la question de leviers physiques et logiques qui permettraient d'optimiser l'impact environ- mental (sur le plan énergétique et matière) des réseaux. Quatre solutions ont été discutées :la mise en veille de certains équipements du réseau ,la mutualisation des réseaux fixes et mobiles ,les systèmesde edge computing83et les small cells84 La capacité des réseaux mobiles est déterminée par les « puits de trafic », c’est-à-dire les points forts où se concentrent les utilisateurs. Ces points forts sont générés par différents facteurs tels que leur proximité à un centre urbain important ou une grande agglomération, leur densité populationnelle ou encore leur implantation sur un territoire pratiquement sans bornes à travers lequel circulent beaucoup de véhicules. Les réseaux fixes ont tendance à se concentrer autour de ces points forts tandis que ceux mobiles se dispersent un peu partout.

1. Résumés the key points of the following presentation: 
- Networks can have negative effects on other networks; important aspects of network functioning, such as quality of service vs., duration of equipment life at this workshop, Arcep wanted to (on these two first aspects - activation and education in a more pedagogical perspective) or the maintenance of beneficial competition between experts and non-experts on behalf of the final user (on the question of physical and logical levers that would allow optimizing environmental impact (energy and material)) . Four solutions were discussed: network equipment activation, network sharing between fixed and mobile networks, edge computing systems 83 and 84 with small cells. 
2. Mobile networks are determined by "traffic pumps", which are points where a lot of users congregate. 
3. Fixed networks tend to concentrate around traffic pumps while mobile networks disperse a bit everywhere. Mobile networks are deployed on different types of sites: "classic" sites, which correspond to traditional sites (malls, schools, etc.), and "small cells," which are located in public spaces (parks, squares).
- Small cells allow for more traffic to be redirected from classic sites, which allows the network to be operated more effectively in mode watch.
- The use of small cells avoids the densification of the network by installing classic mobile sites. The discussion was organized by the Arcep in order to think about the various challenges related to quality service, access to networks and connectivity technologies.
- Participants discussed a variety of issues related to energy efficiency and environmental infrastructure deployment. They emphasized the need for multiple connectivity technologies in order to support digital life and enable users greater freedom. The document discusses the fact that with new technologies, "individual responsibility should not be offering, marketing incentives and not supplant the state's role." 
-Social norms that can only help to increase consumption were raised as important, and still unresolved issues. 
-The participants were concerned about the government's ability to act directly on consumer behavior, and its impact on the environment and carbon emissions. 
-Some participants wanted a more global perspective, questioning business models and environmental/social standards of companies. 
-Some believed that there needed to be clear challenges set for what constitutes quality environmental and social products; while others lamented the lack of structural variables allowing private actors to act effectively and efficiently. 
-Questions remain: should we reduce consumption of data? Usage? Or do we take more direct action on environmental impact and emissions from these usages? Cybersécurité can include lists of security issues to these concerns, it and should take effort to precise evaluation of the impact environmental construction of a digital more social than physical world?
-The combination of security imperatives Possesses unique spe- cificities (e.g. reducing energy consumption for mes)? matters deserving examination?
-How allow for better management environmental impact without compromising an ever greater ambition in favor of security and confidence?
-It is also necessary to ask if there are any attrac- tions between them, either in terms of proximity or challenges in common? 
-Cybersécurité cannot rely on traditional security measures while still aiming for an ambitious goal of securing society and building trust. The goal of the project is to shift away from traditional models of economic thinking in order to better serve customers 
-Some of the ways that this will be done include changing the models used for pricing and product development, as well as encouraging energy efficient design in terminals, services, and content 
-Another goal of the project is to improve measurement techniques so that providers can more accurately assess their environmental impact The document discusses the need for a low-carbon model for our country, and the systematic integration of environmental aspects convinced that the digital revolution can be a powerful force from conception and development of products (key lever to address environmental issues) with an aim to reducing the amounts confronted. 
-Environmental impacts occur throughout their lifecycle in equal or superior service rendered. Digital technologies, electronic progress offers numerous opportunities to be seized, immense possibilities. 
-The ADEME must develop an offer of products, goods, moving towards mutualization, sharing and optimization of digital and services high performance environmentally aware resources. The document discusses new products and the sector of repair in particular, which is a productivist and predatory culture that can generate jobs that are less localized and more environmentally friendly.
-It is necessary to allow synergy between the two transitions, the transition to a digital world and the environmental transition, as both cannot be accomplished without cooperation from different actors.
-There are several axes of work for ADEME: understanding impacts on product use from digital technology, reducing energy consumption, resources usage, and greenhouse gas emissions; educating consumers on proper use of technologies; assessing environmental impact across all life stages of a product; developing metrics for multiple criteria.
-Evaluation of environmental impact requires an analysis of the entire life cycle of a product. Questions about over-equipment, frequency of use in an integrated approach. ADEME seeks to continue its renewal efforts by addressing these topics The document discusses how digital has benefited the economy in all sectors.
-Digital has the potential to be a lever of environmental transition development, and its impact on product repair (due to increased connectivity).
-Organized workshops by the Arcep have been beneficial for complex products or services with an ecological design.
-It is also important to develop user information and understanding of digital's implications, so that users can be more responsible for their actions.
-Stakeholders need to establish consensus around digital boundaries and its key issues, which is essential for effective communication.
-Measuring and sharing common understandings about digital usage among key actors is important in order to create responsible decisions. The AFNUM is involved in a number of projects related to repairability and sustainability (reparability and durability indices, restoration funds, spare parts, warranty, software updates…) -The French government's new consumer agenda, called the "circular economy" plan, will have concrete European legal translations in 2021. -It is important to avoid discounting existing legislative frameworks when considering potential digital use interventions.

-The impact of digital uses on the environment is complex due to the technicality of products and indirect emissions such as transport, shopping and use in downstream sectors. 
-ACV and detailed carbon accounting reports from all actors would help mitigate the lack of data. 
-A carbon footprint requires a number of assumptions that are difficult to verify which can lead to skepticism about results. 
-To reduce environmental impact effectively it is mainly consumer restraint (e.g., using less) and eco-design principles (e.g., reducing waste) that need to be implemented together with reliable information on carbon footprints. The government can participate in environmental groups beyond French borders. 
-The Group Altitude shares the concerns of the Authority and allows those involved to exchange or define public powers concerning the effects of climate change. 
-Many actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions seem to have been forgotten, while mobile and digital usage is only a small part of overall emissions. 
-It is probable that networked technologies such as smart cars or all electric vehicles will constitute a significant share of emissions in the future. The document discusses the need for partnerships with private sector actors specifically focused on this topic of prospective management.
-It can be difficult for producers to maintain long term economic interests while maintaining ownership of their product. This will lead to reconsidering relationships between producers and consumers. The document discusses the need for marketeers to be more responsible and push their positions not only due to regulations, but also the expectations of citizens.
-A training program for marketers to learn about these concepts is essential in order for them to compete effectively.
-85 The document discusses how digital technology must play an important role in sustainability, and how it should include all filières with which interactions exist. 
-The document stresses the importance of reducing environmental impact, and notes that digital technology can achieve this by creating value as well as reducing emissions. 
-Operators must avoid always stronger demands from their customers, caused by a "silo" approach that ignores other parts of society. First, the document discusses how sober digital technologies should be in order to have positive externalities for all sectors.
- Second, the document discusses how ambitious digital technologies must be in order to avoid negative environmental impacts.
- Third, the document discusses how other studies are less optimistic about the impact of digital technologies on the environment than Bouygues Telecom.
- Fourth, Bouygues Telecom cites an Arcep report as an example of how awareness of environmental impacts is beginning to take hold but needs to be better understood and controlled. The document discusses the issue of wastefulness in our current digital age and how it has led to a growing fracture between electronic equipment. 
-The passage on still being difficult to accept is especially relevant in light of 5G's potential to exacerbate local problems. The document discusses the importance of 5G compatibility and disposal of old electronics.
-The CLCV calls for constant vigilance in regards to the effects of 5G on health.
-Regulation is important in relation to the digital space, and car elles are one way that citizens and regulators can collaborate.
-Data after being requested by the Minister for Ecology and Environment would be considered as collective data under the responsibility of Secretary of State for Digital Affairs. The document discusses the strategy of interministerial cooperation to develop a digital footprint and reduce environmental impact in France.
-The strategy includes three axes: reducing the environmental impact of digital transformation, making digital transformation an effective tool for ecological transition, and developing knowledge about the environmental impact of digital transformation.
-The Conseil national du numérique has published a roadmap for reducing the environmental impact of digital technologies, with 2030 as the target year for achieving zero net emissions of greenhouse gases without compensating measures.
-In October last year, the Conseil national du numérique released a report recommending that data be made available for public interest purposes. The document discusses the possible future of energy, and includes discussion of self-driving cars and the impact they may have.
-The document notes that self-driving cars are not yet a reality, and that there are a number of concerns surrounding their deployment.
-The document also discusses the need for active education around energy issues, as well as government engagement in this area. The document discusses the negative effects of digital technologies, specifically how they are a pharmakon or poison as described by Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler.
-Now we move on to measure. Measurement is a prerequisite for action, and it is at the root of everything.
-I advocate institutionalization - everyone needs to do it. This prerequisite is the only one capable of overseeing, through a voluntary approach leading to timely results in our organizations, the following steps in avoiding harm and defining a framework for thinking, policies and actions around reducing negative digital impact benefits almost exclusively for a responsible digital world.
-A structured approach based on exclusive use of leverage mechanisms that allows without betraying trust an approach CMERC - meaning Understand->Measure->Avoid-.
-Reducing->Compensating. The document is about Covage's efforts to reduce its carbon emissions. 
-The document lists the three major emission points for Covage - transportation, waste, and water consumption - and provides estimates for each activity. 
-The document also discusses Covage's environmental responsibility goals and how they were achieved in 2018. The document discusses the benefits of climate change awareness and how ARCEP plans to implement it. 
-The section on deployment outlines our emissions related to transportation, and highlights the use of fiber optic cables for this purpose. 
-The section has the goal of disappearing once our networks are deployed. Software obsolescence is often due to close interaction between software and hardware, for example, with BIOSes playing a key role in server maintenance. 
-Daily has two types of limitations: 1) energy consumption limits related to certification of data center components; and 2) a small part of their total carbon footprint comes from their electronic equipment consumption. 
-For instance, nonintentional software locks (related to the mismatch between the majority of data center emissions and hardware capabilities) account for 77% of an electronic equipment's total carbon footprint. 
-According to ITRenew (The financial & sustainability case for circularity, Ali Fenn &Florian Fesch, April 2020), 77% of an electronic equipment's total carbon footprint comes from its manufacturing phase. We believe that open source is a particularly important path forward in addressing software obsolescence issues, as well as CO2 emissions caused by electricity usage. Criteo is a multinational technology company that provides reliable and relevant advertising to marketing professionals around the world. 
- Criteo's advanced machine learning technology is based on unmatched data sets, making it an ideal choice for targeting highly specific audiences. 
- The CSA Council Superior of Audiovisuals has issued a report stating that video online would account for 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to Spain. 
- Studies have been conducted in connection with the creation of a radiophone sectoral center, as well as in relation to environmental impacts associated with digital media usage. 60% of global internet traffic growth is due to streaming video 
-High-speed networks and the continued growth of connected devices are two factors that contribute to this growth 
-French people watched on average 6.6 hours of online video per week in 2020, an increase of 8.1% over 2019 
-This represents 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to Spain’s 300 million tonnes CO2 annually emitted Ericsson is urging for a more sustainable digital future, believing that infrastructure and terminal exchanges should be open to each other in order to improve efficiency.
-In terms of environmental impacts, they believe that artificial intelligence has the potential to reduce climate change by reducing the need for human labor.
-They also think that wider discussion about network architecture is needed in order to limit consumption and make sure 5G doesn't have negative impacts on the environment. 5G is a new wireless technology that will allow for faster internet speeds. 
-5G has the potential to reduce environmental impacts, but it will require both urgency and pragmatism in order to be effective. 
-There are different stakeholders who consider 5G an asset that should best serve their needs or even various technologies. 
-Evaluating the impact of streaming on consumption is not immediate since most energy consumed by networks is fixed and does not depend on traffic. 
-However, mobile network consumes less per subscriber but fixed is more efficient in bits transmitted; WiFi is often seen as an interesting solution but WiFi routers are rarely turned off at night (and more connected objects in a home, like heating and security, make people less likely want it turned off, even during the night or absences). 
-Mobile network allows mobility-based usages become part of our daily lives and offers a lower cost coverage in rural or remote areas. "Aujourd'hui, grâce aux progrès de la technologie, les centres d'IA pour optimiser la consommation d'énergie ne consomment qu'environ 1 % de carbone."
- "Les centres d'IA pour optimiser la consommation d'énergie ont progressé beaucoup depuis 2015."
- "Ces progrès permettent notamment de connecter plus de choses et de traiter plus de données afin de mieux comprendre notre consommation énergétique et de réduire les émissions par 15 % sur la période 2020." The document discusses how digital technologies have an environmental impact and how operators need to take measures at the heart of our daily use patterns, in education systems, in our social lives, and also be responsible for sustainable development practices. 
-The deployment of 5G is only just beginning, and it will take years to provide this service to the largest population. 
-While many rural territories do not have a number of 5G towers, new offers and replacements for consumers' terminals are multiplying. 
-5G promises faster speeds and is already available, but it may be misleading to consumers and the digital sector is carrying major responsibility in guiding people in their choices so they can be the actors of a sustainable digital society. The health crisis has only made more clear the lack of an ADSL quality service, depriving families of being able to ensure compatibility among various electronic equipment and work from home, school-to-home or even online shopping during confinement.

-To finance the broadband education plan dedicated to sobriety requires that we liberate operators of digital technology and allow for less regulation of usage.

-128kbps to 512kbps should be the minimal threshold for content providers, including advertising agencies, as well as producers and distributors of high-speed content.

-The responsibility for this impact on environment falls squarely on those in charge of digital media. The document discusses a possible tax on data.
-The agenda of the digital economy is opposite: everywhere, there is talk only of "the new black" - products and services that are marketed to a large audience, such as a 5G phone and an 8K TV, data.
-Environmental impact is displaced and not reduced by this behavior. It's shifted away from citizens or NGOs who would use it more responsibly. This presents an economic major challenge that is similar to what has happened with fossil fuel divestment. The markets section discusses how electronic devices are being used more and more, and how there is an urgency to use digital technologies quickly
-The markets section also discusses the rise of gamification and the abundance of data. In this area, vast fields of ecological data are reflections that are opening up to define collectively the foundations for a sustainable digital economy
-Reflections on territorialization coincide with an institutional sequence in France that asserts public policies related to ecology. Setting up local governance for digital affairs will allow for a more effective penetration of digital technologies into territories The document discusses the environmental impacts of technology, in particular, the impacts of electronic devices and data centers.
-The main growth area for emissions from ICT sectors is imports from connected devices to better manage their environmental impact: TVs, computers, etc.
-One of the priority objectives for public authorities should be to measure this impact with precision and objectivity.
-The unpublished detailed elements below, demonstrating that telecoms are a key sector to face environmental challenges.
-These performance results are the result of actions taken by telecom operators for years, both on networks and terminal equipment.
-Moreover, telecoms have an essential role in meeting environmental challenges by contributing positively to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from other industrial sectors. The document discusses the risk of contradictory government actions between issues of digital sovereignty and industrial relocation and the issue of reducing energy-intensive activities.
-France has a durable city strategy that considers "ACV solutions for territorial resilience and urban sustainability, which is a standardized multidisciplinary cycle life product approach (ISO 14040 and 14044)") to better understand the real relevance of their use and especially their impact. 
-The use of digital tools is an obvious asset in dealing with rare earths: understanding how to use them strategically to mobilize global stocks of rare earths is a major geopolitical issue. Today, systemic approaches, strengthening system-based approaches, mobilizing global stocks of rare earths, are all focused on China more broadly taking into account stakeholder participation. However, this last provides 90% of world needs for industry. 
-The electronic recycling sector is complex and still in its infancy; electronic waste requires specific knowledge about how to recycle it. However, it is often presented as the new recycling technique that is being studied. Rare earths are not scarce because there are limited stocks but because they are dependent on technologies like LCD screens that can be replaced by newer models more easily. The document discusses the environmental impacts of digital production, and how it has led to massive new vulnerabilities in terms of resilience against industrial chain-related risks. 
-The growth of demand for rare metals (like neodymium) is causing unprecedented levels of environmental damage, with annual growth rates reaching 2500%. 
-The use of digital technologies facilitates the transfer and sharing of data, as well as the reduction in prices. This is a key tool in anticipating phenomena such as cyber security threats or urban and territorial fragmentation. 
-A standardized life cycle approach for products made with digital technologies must be taken into account (ISO 14040 and 14044). They are also sensitive to events leading to power outages... The document discusses ways to ensure economic opportunity for France.
-France and Europe are still key in terms of national independence in terms of hosting data centers.
-There is a lack of legal certainty for all businesses, which is inevitable with the growth of the digital age.
-A holistic view is needed when dealing with the intersection of these different aspects of the digital age. Google plans to reduce the amount of plastic used in their packaging by 50% by 2025. 
-This is done through machine learning which was able to identify ways to reduce the amount of plastic used without compromising the quality of their products. 
-Google is also working on sustainable energy sources for their data centers so that they can continue providing high quality services while using less resources. The goal of the document is to reduce consumption of digital content.
- The main impact of digital technology on the environment takes place primarily during production of electrical equipment and during end-of-life management measures.
- There needs to be more reuse of technology through directives such as a European Union eco-design directive, mandatory recall and reconsidering job retraining programs.
- Extended warranty laws need to be strengthened.
- Users need to have more control over software updates.
- International standards should be used in order to help users better understand how their devices are affecting the environment. The 2020 edition of the consumption survey was an opportunity to interrogate for the first time the internet users on their environmental perception of their cultural usage. 
-The study found that 43% of all internet users consider the environmental impact of their online cultural consumption, with 55% of 15-24 year olds agreeing this is a strong or very strong impact. This is stronger for young people than older respondents. 
-The main driver behind this change in attitude appears to be awareness about the energy consumption implications of digital culture, with 66% of those surveyed indicating they are more likely to consume less digital cultural products as a result. The introduction of a software design guideline by the AGEC law will help increase the durability of digital products. 
-It is important to consider a product's ecological footprint when designing it, and also to promote recycling and repair techniques for electronic equipment. 
-It is necessary to develop a system that tracks product usage and collects data on how long products last. 
-HOP calls for actively fighting against software obsolescence, and including the concept of software obsolescence in the definition of planned obsolescence. 
-Two types of software obsolescence affect electronic equipment: material and functional. 
-Material obsolescence is caused by the hardware's fragility, and results in consumers having to replace their devices more often, while functional obsolescence is due to the fact that updates become incompatible with older versions or that new features are added but old ones removed. 
-HOP recommends separating corrective updates from performance updates, so that users can choose which they want without affecting their device's security. The document discusses ways in which the culture industry should reposition itself to take into account the impacts of climate change on digital media usage.
-The document also calls for a shift in cultural practices towards online experiences that are more environmentally sustainable.
-There is a lack of resources and expertise available to professionals in the culture industry, making it difficult to implement policies aimed at reducing digital media consumption. The Mel plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2023 through its new Climate Plan 
-The MEL places environmental issues at the heart of practical considerations and this should result in new actions being taken in connection with land planning, prevention, reorganizing collection systems, developing technology infrastructure partnerships and increasing recycling and reuse rates 
-The Mel promotes any form of mutualization of networks to ensure a rational and sustainable use of its territory 
-The Mel is also pleased with the implementation of a 4G network shared by all operators in Lille metro since 2014 which demonstrates once again the importance of mutualization for efficient communication The document discusses the development of an approach to ACV as a decision criterion and digital reasoned, with conscious and mastered usages.
- Appropriate means and optimized services are necessary in order to improve coordination between users and promote sustainable digital behaviors.
- In addition, the Mel supports Arcep's proposal "House of Technology" - voice of the ARCEP - defining a national plan for prevention of digital addiction. Services have a significant impact on the entire life cycle.
- There is a need to harmonize production, distribution, and disposal in order to minimize environmental impacts.
- Digital services cause environmental impacts and need to be addressed with guidance that conforms to international climate standards.
- Solutions that take into account environmental impacts across all stages of life cycle are needed. The document discusses satellite internet speeds and their benefits. 
- The document also mentions that there are specific areas where speeds of 30 or 50 Mb/s are necessary, depending on the duration of use. 
- The document goes on to say that reducing consumption is achieved by modifying service offerings without replacing equipment. 
- Finally, the document talks about how OVHcloud plans to achieve "zero emissions" by 2030. Ovhcloud is a 15-year old French company that specializes in environmental impact analysis of businesses. 
-Their process for industrializing the cloud, designing infrastructure, and fully integrating renewable energy sources has led to the best possible response to climate change, while also promoting circular economy needs among their customers. 
-The overall energy consumption of data centers has stabilized due to improvements made in servers and cloud usage. This is mainly due to the increasing use of cloud services which can share and absorb the impact from old buildings that are being re-adapted into data centers. 
-Optimization of infrastructure is an essential but only partial solution; it cannot solve all aspects of data center energy consumption. OVHcloud does not use air conditioning to maintain the problem. Beyond this work, it is then necessary cooling of its servers. Since 2003, it has been replaced by evaluating the entire chain of impact and looking at them systemically through water cooling (watercooling): upper layers, applications, analyze codebase for water usage; reduce drastically The document discusses the negative aspects of data centers, and how they are not balanced energetically.
-The digital world: an illusion? The limits of PUE -Relying on artificial means to create a semblance of reality instead is fatal for information technology.
-A data center with a very low PUE can continue to do nothing about the energy generated by the hardware in its computers.
-Qarnot's distributed approach allows for this by distributing the power use across many sources. Qarnot's approach is to reduce carbon emissions by 89% when the city or building is not involved in the process (-89%).
-The approach of Qarnot, with its focus on digital technology, is seen as a solution that can distribute computing power directly into buildings.
-The "digital" term encompasses a wide range of realities and sectors. Some techno-optimists like the World Economic Forum believe that it will lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 15%.
-Le modèle économique est fondamental pour les secteurs qui profitent de l’efficacité et de l’optimisation permises par les modèles climatiques. The document discusses the role of digital infrastructure and services in a world of life.
-The ACV (actual, committed and potential) data of car manufacturers is stabilizing at 2°C?
-Then he surpassed us. We followed his lead by working collaboratively with the state to pursue an effusive race to innovation: Digital has become a defining factor in designing new digital jobs According to the defender of rights, by 2020, digital inclusion will be a factor of exclusion in educational courses.
-Schools should "Sustainable by design" and consider environmental (and social) impacts when planning for the future.
-It is not enough to work on solutions for tomorrow; we need citizens to regain confidence that we can face tomorrow's challenges. We - Businesses – need to work on restoring trust first by demonstrating that ultimately science and consciousness can work together And be exemplary. TeleCoop believes that the telecom providers' economic model is unsustainable and encourages customers to manage their data responsibly.
-TeleCoop estimates that 50% of its customer base uses prepaid contracts with an engagement clause.
-TeleCoop suggests amending Arcep's attributions so it can manage frequencies more efficiently. The document discusses how the Authority for Telecommunications Regulation (Arcep) is working to improve the telecommunications sector by engaging with citizens and businesses. 
-The document also discusses how important it is for French digital culture to reflect excellence both environmentally and economically, and points to China's third path as an example of a country that is succeeding in this area. 
-The document highlights the need for policymakers to promote measures encouraging people to keep their devices as long as possible, in order to reduce the amount of data that needs to be collected. The 78TIBCO campaign "Bien" is about encouraging people to use digital technologies in a sustainable way.
-The Nouveau projet proposes penalizing wasteful use of video 4K on part of energy "gray" that it will produce both in advance of mobile in the subway) its exploitation as well as at the end of its life, as well as all quantifiable emissions including on scope 3.
-It is necessary to ban unlimited prepaid offers by operators.
-The role of ARCEP regulator today is limited to telecom networks. It is essential to discourage abusive practices by telecommunications platforms. They represent only a part resting on techniques of marketing attention, practices energy consumption for digital media. However, leading to uncontrolled inflation in digital volumes the effect lever they have vis-à-vis terminals and appliances, and inducing also a loss of free-market discretion altogether, gives choices applied there a responsibility opposed to the original objectives of Internet industrial but more so political on the future of our society. Tibco is a company that wants to be sustainable and help create a digital world that is environmentally friendly.
-One way Tibco plans to do this is by working with other organizations to create a platform for sustainable digital usage.
-Tibco also focuses on transitioning its fleet to electric vehicles and implementing waste management practices that are environmentally friendly both for users and network operators.
-In addition, Tibco has entered into energy contracts that are designated as "green" based on their specific industrial and technological expertise. The goal of society is to be collective and profitable working together with all actors for the common good.
-The French government is trying to reduce the amount of data consumers are using.
-One example of this is a recent bill that would make it harder for consumers to use data on websites and apps.
-This could have a negative impact on consumers because it would be harder to control how many text messages or phone calls they send or make.
-Moreover, limiting mobile data could redefine the way people use their phones. The document discusses the current market landscape and how it is segmented by offers.
-One of the most important tools for using the internet on phones is data quantity, and this could be a problem if the approach taken by the National Digital Council breaks with how consumer lives have been integrated into technology. 
-The major challenges facing the sector include energy consumption management, emissions of carbon, waste production from vehicles, and integrating technologies into vehicles. 
-The European Union has set goals to be 100% renewable by 2021 and 2025 for operations within its borders, while African countries are aiming to achieve this goal by 2025 as well. Vodafone is a telecommunications company with operations in Europe and Africa 
-The company has 12 million connections to intelligent energy meters using its IoT technology 
-Vodafone is one of the largest providers of wireless networks in Europe and Africa 
-The company has committed to developing plans for reducing its carbon footprint 
-Wifirst believes that recommendations for developing plans to minimize the carbon footprint of networks should take into account available protocols on terminals. 
-Quantifying the impact of data flows across all infrastructure operated by Wifirst is important in order to consider how best to minimize network carbon footprints. The document discusses the pros and cons of different telecommunications options, including WiFi and mobile phone usage. 
- It is important to note that wired connectivity is more environmentally friendly than using electronic devices, but this may not be widely known or appreciated. Awareness of environmental impacts is necessary for widespread adoption of wired connectivity. The document discusses the various factors that influence energy consumption. 
-Usage includes things like how people use energy, how much they use, and where they get it from. The document discusses the impact of users on networks, and how different actors (content providers, application providers, operators of terminals, etc.) influence networks. 
-Characteristics such as high pricing and an automatic billing system can lead to increased demand for less environmentally friendly devices. 
-Distribution channels (new, volume consumed) can also have an impact on network sustainability. Tiering refers to the placement of different types of equipment in a data center, with different levels of resource requirements. 
- Aux stratégies d’installation des équipements au sein du centre et ensuite à proposer aux usagers leur usage qui en est fait demande. 
- For example, accessing the contents and applications offered, both on behalf of users as well as from data centers, which are necessary to be accessible by users; at the same time, data is stored in centers terminals; both for being accessible by users, as well as for being centrally located so that it can be accessed by clients’ devices. 
- The influence of digital footprints on public policy has been noted in France. 
- There is an increase in digital footprints due to the use of technology and services. 
- This increase in digital footprints has led to public policies being created to address them. The document discusses the need for better governance of the environment, and how data should be collected in order to make informed decisions.
- The transparency shock indicates a lack of effective governance.
- Information available to the public should be made more accessible and used to inform users and the general public about their choices in consumption.
- Actors should use these tools to discuss and add value to them, slowly. The Arcep has gone further and extended data-driven regulation.
-These discussions have allowed for the agency to identify two main objectives - amplifying its ability to act beyond strengthening its human resources and illuminating regulatory choices or financial considerations - as well as introducing user base understanding tools.
-The document is a preliminary environmental indicators list that some types of actors or services could use. The document discusses the need for a progressive approach to electronic data collection, with indicators including additional studies on emissions from construction work between actors.
-It is suggested that emission data be collected from key operators necessary to achieve an ever more relevant and disaggregated electronic communications data set.
-The ISO 14064-18 standard of 2006 specifies principles and requirements for quantifying and drafting reports on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and their elimination.
-The standard includes requirements for design, development, management, reporting, verification of inventory, among others. The document discusses the need for more accurate environmental indicators, such as consumption of limited resources (biotic, rare earths, etc.), in order to have a reliable and useful vision without becoming too complex. 
-This would allow for a better understanding of how the business impacts the environment and allow for more targeted actions to be taken. 
-In addition to indicators of durability and repairability, an indicator of recyclability might also be useful. The document is about ways to reduce carbon dioxide and energy consumption.
-Some of the measures include improving product reliability.
-The document also discusses ways to reduce energy consumption in industrial applications. The document is about digital consumption and its impacts.
-The document discusses digital consumption levels and how they relate to services.
-The document also discusses the commercial models that service providers, terminal operators, and distributors might use.
-It discusses marketing practices, purchase models, rental models, and sharing models for terminals. Device suppliers concerning energy consumption by equipment: 
- ITEE (IT equipment efficiency) measures service on different OS levels, as well as effective energy consumption over their updates. 
- ITEU (IT equipment utilization) measures efficiency both in terms of physical and virtual resources. 
- Cycle life of devices could be tracked using metrics such as ITEE or ITEU. 
- Data collection from managers or operators of other installations might also be useful in order to get an overview of the environmental impact. The document discusses ways to green computing and electronic communications services and networks so that they are climate neutral by 2050.
-The study will collect data on materials used in data centers, as well as secondary materials that can be useful for analyzing their lifecycle and improving efficiency.
-These findings will help improve data center design and operation. The document discusses different aspects of network maturity and the ways in which data can be collected to measure it.
-Some indicators are already available or research is ongoing, such as electricity consumption and environmental impacts.
-Other indicators, such as updates offered and maintenances, will need to be determined before they can be measured. The document discusses ways to improve energy efficiency, with a focus on wireless networks 
-One issue is that there is no consensus on how to measure energy efficiency 
-Transitioning to a digital and environmentally friendly society will require more than just technological change; it will also require changes in policy The document discusses the ARCEP's view that there is now a global movement towards fiber infrastructure, and supports their goal of developing new means to integrate connectivity and efficiency. 
- The two fixed networks in France are not encouraging a viable economic transition, and would also represent an overconsumption of fixed-line broadband towards fibre both in terms of energy and resources. 
- In its new regulatory cycle (2021-2023), the ARCEP intends to promote and encourage a transition from copper coverage to fibre throughout the country, owned by Orange. Between copper and fiber will involve coexistence of two networks for a while.
- The ARCEP estimates that the project undertaken by Orange—which it applauds—will have a positive mental impact on society overall compared to the copper network (ADSL or RTC).
- The principle of the de la son principe, remains largely to energy consumption of the infrastructural qualifier for responding to unknowns in terms of. Fiber consumption is thus a such a project raises. It is important to estimated as three to four times less ensure, in order to avoid that this situation that for copper line163 This benefit does not last, only Orange can enter into a contract with respect to the network only part of it, as he has himself defined calendar, and could be diluted by energy-consumption electrical equipment connected at its terminals (Internet box) connected to the copper wire from 2023 and ending in 2030.
- fiber. This can be sup- erior to that of equipment connected to copper wires164, due for example to a greater number of features onboard or higher data and communication speeds. The document cites a report from 2014 which discusses electricity consumption of communication networks and how it has not been keeping up with technological progress.
- Some initiatives or issues were discussed that relate to network optimization and how to take advantage of existing infrastructure when possible. This approach allows for administrative deployments to be more efficient both economically and environmentally since it limits the amount of new construction needed.
- The goal is to reduce waste generation and ensure proper regulation of the Arcep.
- Regarding copper and fiber networks, the Arcep plans to address these practices with operators, especially in terms of cumulative kilometers traveled.
- Finally, the Arcep also proposes to approach these practices with operators, in line with their very great majority belonging to Orange and expressing concerns at several workshops on network deployment in copper. The document mentions that in 2008, the Arcep created mechanisms to automatically suspend access to boxes used by engineers in the civil engineering department at Orange. 
-Operators are obligated to use infrastructure during certain hours or when access is mandated by Orange, which allows for efficient use of extended hours. 
-Wireless networks with a reach of 560,000 kilometers and more than 13 million poles already installed will avoid duplicating an infrastructure with a large footprint. For new deployments, the Arcep intends to be attentive to developing innovative technologies, such as micro trenches under roads, which could limit environmental impact during network deployment construction. One band out of six is currently used to connect 3G networks. 
-These technologies use few resources compared to extinction, and continue to decrease usage of certain applications. 
-Two other ideas need to be considered: first, the residual traffic on 2G and 3G networks should still be significant. 
-And secondly, as foreign examples show, a significant amount of calls on older generations' networks are redirected to more recent technologies in order for them to serve better inside and outside buildings (on average, 80% of minutes on 2G or 3G networks are still transmitted via old technology in 2019). The document discusses various ways in which networks can be designed to have a lower environmental impact. 
-Some of the possible levers include increasing the mutualization of networks, making structural changes, and using edge computing. 
-One potential way to improve environmental impact is to allocate frequencies equally among network nodes. Allows for efficient deployment at large scale and collaborative use of radio technologies and their virtualization 
-Several initiatives are currently underway in order to standardize this technology. See glossary. 
-Regarding the environmental impacts of digital economies, the OECD has published a report in November 2020 entitled « The digital economy outlook » in which it recognizes that the internet presents both opportunities and challenges for sustainable development. For example, while acknowledging the benefits of digital technologies for growth (in terms of green urban development), they may also not open up regular conflict zones. This issue exists also with regard to energy consumption or electronic waste proliferation. 
-Studies in this area might be undertaken as part of upcoming programs in engineering The European Union has initiated a number of studies aimed at strengthening the existing framework for information and communication technology (ICT)
-New environmental standards are also being drafted for public markets based on eco-design principles
-The resolution urges the Commission to take measures to improve value chain circularity 
-The necessary criteria for constituting a true digital market are thus in favor of harmonized approaches The document discusses the importance of smartphones for accompanying these first initiatives. 
- Some key advantages for supporting these initiatives are that they are in line with the European Parliament’s resolution from 25 November 2020. 
- The Commission has published a recommendation entitled “The Green Pact for Europe” in December 2019, which aims to promote high-speed broadband investments and propose a toolkit to reduce the costs of deployment. 
- Point 3. (16) encourages member states to develop better practices and incentives in favour of reducing environmental impact during network deployment. 80% of the carbon footprint of digital technology in France is from terminals 
- The aim is to make it more fashionable or due to the increase in digital technology in France: sufficient public policies to face the growth of usages? 
- Commercial practices or advertising incentives are needed to promote a renewal very rapidly. 
- The 2009 European Union directive on ecoconscious design applies at present only to “energy products” and does not include smartphones or TVs, but Commission has announced its intention to extend the directive’s scope during its 2020-2024 plan. Public authorities, think tanks, NGOs are some of the most visible actors in the digital sphere 
-There is a need for methodologies aimed at reducing environmental impact when adopting digital services or applications 
-Green design principles could be referred to as measures that reduce wear and tear on batteries and other components in devices The importance of transparency so that actors can make commitments, through a code of conduct, with third parties. 
-A better performance, by reducing the interoperability of APIs (environmental interface for terminals via programming)185, would allow extending their life span. 
-Another measure often mentioned is distinguishing updates that must be installed automatically for long term device reliability from those that can be installed selectively for user convenience. 
-The recycling industry remains constrained by its ability to efficiently manage resources and control emissions The document discusses the 2019 public opinion on reconditioning terminals and how it has changed from 99.9% in charge of reconditioning in 2010189 to a positive trend for the next user of terminal.
-The key issue now is moving towards a dissociating sale of reconditioned terminals with generalization of the sale, which would reassure buyers about the terminal's long-term durability and subscription service.
-On this topic, Arcep thinks that she could bring and provide more detailed knowledge about practices involving malicious software installation on digital devices, which could be developed in a more in-depth way through public advertising campaigns.
-The aim would be to make it easier for new models to emerge without relying on sales of terminals based on traditional hardware The document discusses marketing approaches that have been successful in the past. 
-Initiatives based on functionality rather than design are desirable, as they will fuel future editions of Arcep's digital barometer. 
-Participants at workshops mentioned environmental models that encourage contributors, obsolescence of cultural terminals, and lack of a virtuous model in itself. 
-One way to explore this possibility is through the provision of models that are environmentally friendly, such as rental schemes that reduce incentives for users to keep old terminals running if they are looking to purchase new ones. However, in the context of massification and the development of internet-of-things objects, this question deserves particular attention. CDN : Content Delivery Networks -FAI : Fournisseur d’accès à internet -Netflix : Netlix -Google : Google -Akamai : Akamai The document discusses ways to reduce the environmental impact of electronic services.
-The proposed measures include a tax or fee that would be disproportionate to the expected benefits.
-One proposal is to create a code of conduct for data usage, which would include good practices for the largest streaming video actors. This measure would fund the digital solidarity fund (DSF). The document discusses the pros and cons of various methods for cooling data centers.
- One option is to use refrigeration, which has a relatively low environmental impact.
- If the temperature exceeds the target, on-closing the refrigeration system can be used.
- It is possible to reduce the environmental impact of a data center by using evaporation to cool air.
- Automatic systems allow for a stable temperature all year round without using energy from cooling units. The document mentions that in order to take full advantage of the energy efficiency features of data centers, it is necessary that the ratio between energy used and energy delivered be in line with specificities of this sector and the nature of the data center's center of operations.
-If a data center is designed in accordance with good practices identified on current data centers, then legal obligations pertaining to environmental protection should also be taken into account.
-It remains to be seen whether European economic actors will take up this responsibility. The document discusses ways in which actors in the data ecosystem can better understand their responsibilities and comply with relevant legal obligations.
-One goal of this document is to help users reduce their environmental impact by using more efficient data storage solutions.
-Government action should not be limited to economic incentives only, but should also focus on building user trust and confidence. The document discusses ways that tools can be cited for detailed tutorials on this subject: agro-industrial repair, cosmetics and food sectors, « Openfoodfacts 199 » and « Yuka 200 » applications provide clear and precise information to users, accompanied by elements allowing them to choose products based on their needs.
-In terms of coverage and quality of service, « Mon réseau mobile 201 » or « Ma connexion internet 202 » developed by the Arcep provide users with knowledge of the coverage they will benefit from at various times in their lives (at home, at work...).
-A system of tools to measure quality is also being developed by the Arcep: a « Quality Observatory 203 ».
-The government could also consider launching an appeal for projects aimed at imagining and building these environmental regulation tools if public action was intensified in this direction.
-Other tools may emerge if no third initiative emerges to take up this responsibility. The Arcep is a French regulatory agency that has been working on proposals for reducing the environmental impact of digital actors. 
-The document discusses ways in which the government can use its power to regulate the internet. 
-One focus of the document is on getting the government to use its power to develop and implement policies that will reduce carbon emissions from digital activities. The Arcep's proposals are divided into three movements: (i) better understanding and monitoring environmental impact of different sectors and actors of digital technology by providing public authorities with solid instruments for strategic management, (ii) incorporating environmental issues into regulatory choices both when it comes to networks and mobile devices, (iii) increasing economic incentives - providers and users - through various policy levers.
-The essential elements for environmental evaluation and follow-up of the sector's footprint are 2. Participating, within its initiatives with ADEME in the creation of a reference framework: Improving measurement to identify issues, convey data so that users can be informed and encouraged to act virtuously on the sector. AXE 2: INTEGRATING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IN REGULATION ACTIVITIES 
-3. Supporting copper transition to fiber networks: This will help reduce emissions from telecommunications equipment as well as improve network reliability. 
-4. Encouraging network optimization by supporting mutualization of civil engineering and telecommunications infrastructure (access networks). This will help reduce congestion on networks while also improving performance. 
-5. Encouraging initiatives aiming at implementing automatic network management measures for box operators during specific hours or extended periods without use. These measures would help optimize network usage while reducing emissions from communications equipment. 
-6. Fine-tuning analysis of positive and negative impacts of a mobile phone network extinction on barriers possible and ensuring that good incentives are put in place. This would help ensure that any negative impacts from a mobile phone network extinction are minimized while still allowing for innovation in the industry. 
7. Studying 2021 changes to indicators measuring "performance" of networks in order to include environmental impact in consumer choice parameters This would allow consumers to make moreinformed decisions about which type of network is best for them based on both performance criteria as well as environmental considerations The document discusses ways to improve the way users drive and deserve better environmental impact assessments.
-There should be an effort made towards "regulating by data" which would help develop tools for consumers. A "environmental barometer" could be created to measure best practices across all digital ecosystems.
-The French government's Climate Action Plan includes proposals for reducing consumption of energy from digital sources by 50% by 2050.

-The "rebound effect" occurs when this technological improvement actually leads to an increase in energy consumption. The document discusses the installation, fixes and mobile emissions of an organization located within its organizational boundaries.
-Emissions from sources controlled by the organization, such as combustion of fixed and mobile sources, industrial processes not involving combustion, emissions from ruminants, biogas from technical landfill centers, fluid leaks from chemical processing plants, agricultural fertilization with nitrogenous compounds, etc. are all included in this category.
-Indirect emissions associated with electricity production, heat production or imported products are also included in this category. Steam for activities within the organization are also considered here.
- Other indirect emissions (SCOPE 3) resulting from activities within the organization are also taken into account. These might include purchases of resources like materials or services, employee movements, transport upstream and downstream of goods shipments, disposal management related to activities within the organization; production output including product life cycles; and environmental impact assessment of business decisions.
- Codecs are programs that are used for the transformation of source files into new files. 
- The development of more efficient codecs (and thus methods for encoding) allows for a savings in the amount of data necessary to disseminate a given quality file. 
- Primary energy: Primary energy represents the "potential" energy contained in natural resources (like wood, gas, oil, etc.) before any transformation. It differs from "final" energy because production processes, transport and transformation of resources often lead to losses. 
- Provider of content and applications (PFA): A company that provides multimedia or information technology services to its users through a network (usually the internet). 
- Greenhouse gas (GHG): These gases contribute to climate change and are one of the factors causing global warming. They encompass several gases among which water vapor, carbon dioxide or methane. For simplification purposes, GHGs and "carbon" (for CO2) are often used alternatively since CO2 present in the atmosphere and anthropogenic origin is responsible for most of the anthropogenic effect on climate and contributes according to the GIEC report 78% of global emissions between 1970 and 2010. The term "environmental impact" does not refer to more specific concepts such as "carbon footprint" or "emissions GES." 
-Intensity carbon refers to the ratio of emissions of CO2 to production of Internet-of-Things companies (IoT). 
-The neutrality of the Net or network neutrality is a principle that guarantees equal treatment for all data flows on internet. The PUE metric is used to evaluate energy efficiency of a data center.
-The network access refers to all means connecting telecommunications terminals to a switch in infrastructure network. In fixed broadband example, it usually refers to local loop segment between subscriber and Network Access Point (NAP) for fiber or NAP for copper if there is no fiber connection available at customer's premises.
-Backbone networks represent main part of infrastructure networks characterized by high bandwidth, which concentrates signals coming from other parts of the infrastructure networks and transports them between them or towards other backbone networks. The goal of the workshop was to explore the links between cybersecurity and environment, starting with the concept of risk. 
-The participants were from France, Europe (ENISA) and the francophone world. 
-The goals of the workshop were to explore the links between cybersecurity and environment, and to discuss how risk affects both domains. 
-One part of the goal was to present an approach to environmental impact management that is applicable in digital systems. 
-Another part of the goal was to discuss whether there are any commonalities between cybersecurity and environment that warrant closer examination. If so, what synergies might exist between Atelier partner specialists from both domains? The document discusses the need for an ecologic transition in digital technology and provides a number of solutions through group deliberations.
-The workshop first allowed for the identification of risks affecting both society and economy due to uncontrolled cyber threats. In 2025 these risks could lead to a collapse of society or even an economic model. The concept of crisis is used when events take on a significant scale, often beyond the boundaries of one state. 
-The challenge of protecting ecosystems from cyberattacks (e.g., defending against cyberattacks) is also complex and logical, requiring data sharing to enable regulation through data. 
-Cybersecurity is ambitious on the physical security side, but proportionate in terms of equipment (e.g. overheating of data during a heatwave). 
-It is important to consider synergies between cybersecurity and environmental issues, in order to avoid having to make too many compromises between them. For example, it may be possible to develop complementary techniques that would protect both information systems and the environment simultaneously. The document discusses digital waste and how to think about a concept that would unite different concepts of "security by design," "privacy by design," and "sustainability by design."
-The challenge of improving cybersecurity assessments is discussed in this document.
-Among other things, the authors explore ways to cooperate with businesses on specific environmental issues, such as climate change.
-The authors also emphasize the need for precise evaluation of the environmental impact of different cyber security solutions, in order to ensure that they are designed in a sustainable way.
-In addition, the authors propose engaging public sector agencies in dialogue about specific cyber security challenges (such as BYOD).
-Finally, the paper encourages and supports initiatives by all relevant actors when it comes to online ecosystems and cyber attacks.
