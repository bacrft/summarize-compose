-"Le numérique représenterait sources abiotiques (eau, minéraux…) et la consommation d’énergie primaire11."
-"L’Arcep a décidé de se saisir pleinement dans le monde et 2 % de de cet enjeu en s’appuyant sur la mission que lui a confié la loi en 201012 suite au Grenelle de l’environnement"
-"Le numérique représente 3 à 4 % des émissions consommation d’énergie primaire11." The document is about the proposal 150, which is called "Accompagner l’évolution du numérique pour réduire ses impact." 
- The proposal focuses on reducing the environmental impacts of digital technology. 
- Some of the ways to reduce these impacts include reducing energy consumption, recycling, and using less electronic waste. 
- At the national level, emissions from digital technology could increase by 60% by 2040 if nothing is done to limit it. The digital is a powerful collective force that is driving the evolution of society, both economically and socially, as well as in the regulation of tomorrow's everyday life of our citizens and in the evolution of public services. In this light, the Authority is attentive to ensuring that users of networks and services regulated by it follow the mode of action laid down in its Strategy for Digital Regulation, which sets out how they remain masters of their choices and can benefit from contributions from regulation through dialoguing with stakeholders. 
- This perspective is part of a continuous regulatory trend towards distance socialization and the current crisis in regulation. First, Covid-19 published in 2019 a note on "The Mental Dimension of Digital Transformation Is Not Necessarily Bound to Carbon Footprint14" in which it called on actors to combine technologies. The whole issue is to develop digital development in line with society's needs and requirements while taking into account environmental impacts. 
- To achieve this goal, the Authority has decided to increase its power and launched a new requirement for work: "For A Sustainable Digital Economy." This approach integrates a wide range of actors despite social distancing and the current regulatory crisis. First, Covid-19 focused on opening up competition, then on developing its own capacities while being accompanied by an open attitude. Pour ce faire, the document discusses working in favor of the integration of Ouishare, a collective that interrogates clothing for better connectivity in territo- 
- With the environmental issue at hand, Arcep wants to open a new chapter of its regula- ries.  tion with associations, institutions, operators of electronic communications, businesses involved in digital society, civil society actors interested in regulation, and government officials involved. 
- Six online meetings were organized between July and November 2020 to share visions, practices, tools and skills among participants in order to build a collective response. 
- The carbon component (CO2) of an individual's GES footprint only represents one part of their overall environmental impact. The document discusses the importance of a sustainable digital economy, and provides a overview of the different workshops held on the platform. 
-The main points of discussion at the workshops were related to cyber/environmental risks in electronic communications, as well as expanding on topics specific to France's digital future. 
-Five topical workshop themes were initially proposed, with online forum participation in order to keep discussions alive beyond the workshops themselves: 
-Adapting commercial practices for a sustainable digital economy; 
-Laying traps for obsolescence in order to preserve our digital heritage; 
-Defining our networks for a sustainable digital future; 
-Designing services and content that are both sustainable and scalable; and 
-Considering how we can shape our networks for an inclusive and prosperous digital future. Les réseaux ont une empreinte environnementale qui est à prendre en compte dans les décisions sur les infrastructures.
- Les travaux menés par l’Arcep et l’ADEME permettent de mieux connaître cette empreinte.

-The document encourages the transition from fixed networks to fibre optic networks. 
-The document clarifies the issues related to mobile networks. 
-The document urges action at European and international levels. 
-To further reduce the environmental impact of digital data, more in depth studies are needed and a methodology for analysis needs to be developed. 66% of households in T2 2017 and also personal use 77% of homes in T2 2020) although it seems that digital has reached a phase of maturity unavoidable in France (1.1.1).

- In the last quarters17. The duration of new products, services and contents more or less long and the accompanying increase in our pace of using electronic devices is what is causing the trend for rolling stock to age. This implies that there is potential for innovations to be generated by an important stock of equipment being used at a slower rate.

- On the other hand, it is also necessary to take into account environmental impact when considering other sectors’ use of electronic devices and Cisco estimates18 that, as a whole, the number of interconnected devices will reach 18.4 billion by 2018, rising to 29.3 billion by 2023 worldwide. France Strategy considers that the growth of internet of things (IoT)19 will play an important role in this (both for public uses as well as professional ones). The document discusses the growth of digital devices in French households and how that growth is being driven by businesses (such as) as a source of this growth.
- The study found that only 16% of French households rely on traditional TV devices, while 85% have smartphones and 90% have TVs or computers with internet connectivity.
- Devices like televisions and computer monitors account for around 90% of all connected devices in French homes, while smartphones account for around 50%.
- Lower levels of digital content consumption are limiting the potential growth of digital devices in France. Each device can serve either a large number of services (tablets or smart phones) or a small number of services (smart TVs). RFID: Radio-Frequency Identification

- To enable an effective governance, it is necessary to provide good incentives for economic actors and users. This requires sixty different metals which only a handful are recyclable, as well as comprehensive chiffrage so that beneficiaries can benefit from harmonized methods for data analysis and collection management.

-The size of the impact is particularly apparent with regards to carbon dioxide emissions. 
-Both studies conclude that it is necessary to develop a more logical methodology in order to accurately estimate emissions. 
-One study, Citizing, covers a wider area (including consideration of production phases for digital networks and data centers) while the CGE focuses on recent growth trends in online activity. 
-Despite similar findings, both studies argue that there are still obstacles to overcome in order to implement an accurate estimation process. The Shift Project is a project that aims to reduce the carbon footprint of technology.
- The document discusses how increased levels of carbon dioxide emissions could lead to even more usage, which would be offset by fewer consequences.
- There is a need for shared metrics and assumptions based on data that is available from various studies. 
- Some questions remain difficult to deal with due to lack of common metrics and assumptions. The fixed networks seem to be made of carbon component? What should we consume less energy for and how should one calculate it when subscribing to a mobile network? How can we develop sustainable (see supra). However, this point has been nuanced by some actors. The report on individual footprints and the Senate’s measure show that « sectoral networks, avoiding unnecessarily working in wire-line 66 article 13 of the anti-waste law is necessary in order to gather actors for and for a circular economy ».66 It seems then that a joint effort between all actors is necessary in order to define common metrics (clearly defining methods) and develop indicators that would allow us to quantify environmental impacts more effectively.

-The complexity of digital matters is still undervalued and few studies take into account its main drivers and essential steps, in order to minimize its effects.

-The rebound effect refers to the situation where an action has unintended consequences.

-This task is complex and requires time which is naturally long but inexorable, as well as indispensable, in order to define measures relevant and manageable. The document discusses an environmental technology that could improve energy efficiency in a product's life cycle, and which theoretically should involve services.
-For example, a reduction in energy usage effectiveness (PUE)68, which is a measure of an entity's overall energy consumption efficiency, would be one result of this technology.
-W. Stanley Jevons observed in 1865 that the introduction of the steam engine led to an increase in coal consumption even though its use was more efficient than before. This is called the "Jevons paradox."
-Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes developed the "postulate of Khazzoom-Brookes" in 1992, which states that any technological innovation that improves energy efficiency will also lead to increased total energy consumption. Le but de la loi est le développement et l’expérimentation d’un référentiel d’évaluation des impacts environnementaux des services numériques basé sur une approche d’analyse du cycle de vie (ACV).

Pour poursuivre cette ambition : il semble aujourd'hui indispensable, mesurer l'energy allocated to its disaggregation and storage) et le stockage qu'il permet (puisqu'il n'est qu'un ratio permettant de calcul et au refroidissement). The document discusses the need to collect data on environmental impacts of business activities.
-Some data must be collected automatically, such as information on energy use.
-Other data may need to be collected by government officials or industry representatives.
-Indicators of environmental impact should be based on consensus definitions and measurements that are easy to measure.
-Data needs to be updated and revised as new information becomes available. The establishment of article 13 of the previous bill No. NegaOctet which focuses on, for example, registering and categorizing data, is working to produce useful data for quantifying the environmental footprint of digital technology. 
-Some systems of information are resistant to retrieving such data, leaving some shadows unresolved about the implications and dynamics at play. For example, French telecommunications operators seem not to be taking specific action or following it closely today. 
-The cycle of life (ACV) records and quantifies throughout a product’s lifetime all physical flows of matter and energy associated with human activities. See glossary. 
-See glossary for more information. The document discusses the need for more accessible data to study the environmental impact of digital technologies.
-A model that is general but applicable to all will be needed, while an individual model reflecting each actor's choices would be too complex. 
- Coordination between industry, researchers, and public authorities will be necessary to find the balance that ensures effective modeling.
-First, a number of publications and research projects have appeared in recent years raising questions about their relevance and potential impact. This needs to be followed by a dialogue with actors located outside our borders who are increasingly important in terms of environmental impact associated with digital usage.
-Some private actors (manufacturers of electronic minerals and equipment, providers of online content, international non-governmental organizations, national governments, etc.) or public entities (international organizations such as the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], national regulatory agencies, standardization bodies, etc.) may be essential for understanding uncertainties around their implications and developing appropriate actions. The document discusses the importance of international cooperation in order to improve the discussion and decision-making process when it comes to environmental issues. 
-The digital world challenges different perspectives due to the local peculiarities. Dialogue and sharing of good practices between different experts is needed in order to develop internationally recognized methodologies. 
-Several positive initiatives are already underway in this direction. For instance, at the national level, the International Union of Telecommunications (UIT) is working with an environmental footprint for electronic communications that requires collaboration between experts from environment and communication (TIC) fields as well as experts from the digital world, on the entire electronic environmental footprint of communications products in designing international standards (e.g., production, use, end-of-life). Dialogue between these expert fields is necessary for building consensus on accepted methodologies that allow for effectively managing complex situations involving diverse origins. The document discusses electronic waste and how it should be dealt with by the public, in relation to environmental concerns.
- A society that can open up to us is essential for this work. The integration of UIT-T into these studies, as a commission called SG5 «Experience between actors», is essential.
- The results of the study are expected by the end of 2021. As previously mentioned, in response to climate change, 
- The regulation of electronic networks has become an important issue for development (ODD). Furthermore, the Arcep has initiated a reflection on and co-chairs these studies. SG5 considers «sustainability» as one of its working groups and has published guidelines on 2020.
- In France, l’ADEME also supports a research project on Ecocatalysts78 which aims at developing a framework for assessing environmental impacts from information technologies based on an approach to communication (ITU recommendation 140072) and in 2019 criteria for eco-conceptualization79 . French researchers are also involved in this consortium's work under the umbrella of EITRAP80 . The document is titled "ITU-T Recommendation L.101573 - Plus récemment, l'UIT a l'article 13 de la loi AGEC." 
-The document discusses recent changes to the UIT and the article 13 of the AGEC law. 
-The ADEME has also developed a recommendation (ITU-T Recommendation L.147074) which is obviously relevant as an interlocutor with central authorities responsible for coordinating actions with regards to TIC emissions. 
-Works are being undertaken in cooperation with the objectives set out in the agreement between initiators following a joint mission conducted in Paris in 2015. 
-The objective of the study is to compile and analyse indicators of current and future network emissions, as well as evaluate potential strategies for action aimed at limiting environmental impact. The European Commission is trying to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius, in order to reduce the risks and impacts related to climate change.

See glossary.2 EITRAP [listen] TO INCREASE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PARTICIPANTS TO THE WORKPLACE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM The Arcep, in order to better understand and appreciate the environmental impact of digital technology, has desired to enrich its work with contributions from participants in the workplace employment program. In brief, going out into contact with a new ecosystem was felt as necessary after consulting public works reports, as well as those described elsewhere in this report such as in Part One: Background Research. By way of bilateral meetings with engaged experts on the topic, but also by way of widening debates and gathering more voices than ever before through developing a space for dialogue within the collaborative platform “For a Sustainable Digital Future” (2.1), 
NOTES: 
- The European Commission is trying to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050 by engaging different stakeholders involved with digital technology and environment l’Arcep a établi un programme de travail avec cinq thématiques : pour adapter les pratiques commerciales, réduire les obsolescences, protéger les données personnelles, garantir la neutralité du net et améliorer la qualité de l’environnement numérique.
- Les participants ont identifié les priorités à traiter sur le sujet de l’empreinte environnementale du numérique. Parmi elles, on retrouve notamment la question des obsolescences et du développement durable. Octobre: mobile devices, but also terminals and components essential to enabling sustainable digital use – 3 November; consumer consumption of digital. Numérique’s numerical sustainability space – intitulé numeriquesoutenable.arcep.fr – has also opened a online space for participants and facilitators to dialogue on a range of topics and issues related to the topic as a whole. The goal of these ongoing works is to establish first impressions and launch initial action plans in order to move forward over time, starting with the upcoming year.
-The Arcep's work on sustainable digital usage aims to start a conversation between actors across different transversal and social topics, which was explored in detail during the workshop held on 9 July. The document discusses ways to make international meetings more inclusive and sustainable.
-The key topics for discussion were chosen based on questions that were more general, rather than specific actions.
-Ouishare helped the Arcep to diversify its dialogue and work-related tools by providing two online forums: one in September and another in November.
-The workshops allowed participants from different countries to exchange ideas under different formats.
-The synchronous time frames of the meetings allowed for a deeper reflection on fundamental issues of digital sustainability, such as the design of the territory and user freedom. The alternative session formats of plenary and in-session small groups were used at Ouishare. 
- The “fishbowl” principle allowed for more in-depth discussions and interactions to take place between participants. 
- This format facilitated a fluid, spontaneous, and horizontal discussion with a large number of participants. 
- The external view of Ouishare helped to find the right balance between technical feasibility and accessibility. 
- The ANSSI also joined the conversation by responding to the invitation sent out by ARCEP to participants, addressing various topics specific to the platform. 
- The “all knowing, all learners” principle was affirmed throughout the workshop. The workshop was held on 25 November to discuss cyber risk, equality of opportunity, whatever their pro-environmental stance. 
-The goal of the workshop was to provide mutual enrichment among the participants. 
-The discussions were constructive and respectful from the beginning. 
-Each participant was allowed to present themselves as a professional within their organization, without necessarily representing their organization's position. 
-On the online platform "For a Sustainable Digital Economy" (numeriquesoutenable.arcep.fr), which Arcep had created in advance, participants could find summaries of past workshops and access documents about service providers, mobile operators, preparatory meetings for upcoming workshops with distributors of terminals, users… The document discusses the use of post-its bybrutes, and how differentstrategies of advertising this solution had been used, as well as graphical (available here) capabil- itations.
- Finally, some actionable insights were published a posteriori.
- The topic was addressed in two parts. First, at the ARCEP, they wanted to provide everyone an opportunity to share their thoughts on the digital sustainable platform using open online discussion tools. Then participants were asked to elaborate on why certain commercial practices led to a decrease in device lifespan (about 23 months in France for smartphones) and an increase in quantity of devices (IoT etc.).
- Sensitivities ranged from prohibiting such practices outright to proposing incentive mechanisms for sellers of devices (for example, collection of “good practices”). Transparancy and improved user information were also mentioned as supplementary necessary tools for ensuring that users retain a critical perspective on technology development. The ethical approach must be virtuous according to participants. Les pratiques commerciales font des choix éclairés en matière de consommation. 
- L’option d’acheter un terminal neuf pour réduire les risques d’obsolescence est une alternative intéressante. 
- Les participants ont insisté sur le fait que chaque solution doit être explorée selon son impact environnemental. The document discusses the impact of digital sustainability on smartphone, box, and connected objects.
-The challenges posed vary greatly depending on the type of obsolescence discussed.
-Participants were asked to respond to a list of recommendations on how to combat different types of digital obsolescence. 
-Some proposals included distinguishing between evolutionary and corrective updates; two sessions were held to discuss these topics. 
-One session focused on identifying and targeting software obsolescence, while the second session dealt with hardware obsolescence. The following document is about the third atelier of the "Towards a sustainable future for electronics" workshop.
-Some practices remain particularly problematic and go against extending the life of terminals.
-Without being the heart of the workshop (more extensively discussed during atelier 1), the question of cultural obsolescence and social and marketing incentives for terminal renewal was strongly supported by participants.
-For articulating connectivity, resilience, and sustainability, different actors asked various mataritities and concurrences to be taken into account. 
-Regarding technologies, participants were reminded that certain obsolete technologies (such as 2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G) induce certain constraints (such as an increase in “software obesity”).
-Regarding physical obsolescences, participants were asked to consider concepts such as standardization and repairability. The document discusses extensively the issue. 
-Participants in subgroups discussed more transversally, some actors expressing their views on the question: «What networks have been carrying the interrogation about possible privileging when one is situated at home with obsolescence of networks?» 
-The internet of things (IoT) was also mentioned as an environmental factor? 
-Discussions on an important topic, with effects on individual cases or limits, led to three main points. 
-Proposals were asked for concerning user awareness messages or this workshop took part in Industry's logic. 
-Debates started with first measures put into practice based on the initial assumption that wireline broadband should be preferred over WiFi; it was argued that reducing consumer's footprint would be more economical than mobile networks; and that having ecologically responsible professionals involved in product conception would make a big difference. 
-Some actors did not play the same role and had different concerns about certain innovations, such as fixed vs mobile devices. Some participants pointed out that certain networked objects had emerged as crucial.
-Finally, some participants said they were not here to provide answers to questions specific to their field but rather offer general proposals applicable to a variety of needs and uses. Modular density and terminal OS' capabilities to handle streaming video at home are just two examples. The document discusses the environmental impact of passing from one network to another.
- Some factors to consider when making this decision include economic and merit considerations.
- Renewed equipment that offers wireless connectivity is being discussed as a way to increase the environmental impact. 
- Sensitization of users to the environmental impact of each network usage is also being considered. 
- Tools that would help reduce technology use in an energy efficient manner are being discussed, such as automatic and energy saving technologies, especially at the box level. 
- The role of manufacturers and systems administrators is important in deciding whether or not mobile technologies should be switched off old 2G and/or 3G technologies for energy efficiency reasons. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups, with half of them playing "for" and "against" games based on their position on this issue. The document discusses the costs of 26 production of these devices. The most expensive sources are not sought out unless there is a demand surge, when all other sources of production have been sought.
- The objective of this exercise was to get participants to think about their own position and to exchange views on this complex question.
- The last 10 minutes were spent role-playing, with the "for" group becoming "against" and vice versa, in order to allow each participant to express the full range of arguments.
- The diversity of arguments exchanged showed the ambivalence surrounding the subject: it is difficult to determine whether or not environmental impact is relevant in terms of these devices' extinction. 
- Several reasons justifying extinction for digital services and content from older generations were given, among them that mobile networks are more energy efficient than traditional ones: they use more energy while transmitting data and benefit from recent improvements in energy efficiency across components (e.g., better collection performance for streaming data). 
- Some arguments against extinction can be mentioned, such as the fact that digital services offer an increased efficiency in terms of energy consumption: for example, citing online magazine publishers' decision to switch from print editions to digital ones because online publishing offers a higher compression rate for their readers' data flows. The document discusses the extinction of 2G and 3G networks, and identifies which practical material reasons there are for some actors to still use them.
- The participants also noted the importance of including a phase of network production in environmental assessment - which must go beyond just asking about an object's environmental impact because it should also consider how that object will create emissions. 
- They emphasized the need for an arbitrage on the development of certain uses or, at least, optimizing services in order to minimize their environmental impact.
- The ecoconception must also create effects that plateau traffic and reduce data passing through networks. The participants discussed 27 different uses in detail, among them developing a more sustainable economy. The following are bullet points about the document.
-d'action were discussed, video games, streaming, with varied levels of constraint: ecommerce, virtual reality, sensibilization/education for increased use, social networks and more TV shows as well as the limits to their effectiveness were largely addressed.
-Specific questions about content on reading devices, businesses and internet of things were not discussed in greater detail than briefly mentioned.
-There are two groups of participants - those who favor unlimited data plans and those who are in favor of limiting plans to two types of content. 
-Another example of a proposal was studied: the implementation of default design settings that allow for environmentally friendly usage/service The captation graphique of the workshop 4 28 82. See glossary.

After a pedagogical first where participants learned about the technologies discussed, actors were invited to exchange in subgroups and then in plenary on the most relevant solutions based on traffic and how to combine these different levers to imagine more efficient network architectures environmentally. Participants also noted that practices and levers mentioned required fine knowledge of network coverage as well as traffic usage, which allows identifying places where different lever can be effectively used (for example, small cells in high-traffic areas). Finally, participants noted that degree of mutualization of levers discussed should be done carefully depending on their respective impacts.

- Les réseaux mobiles sont déployés sur différents types de sites : « classiques », qui correspondent aux sites traditionnels (marchés, écoles, etc.), et « petites cellules », qui sont des sites situés dans les espaces publics (parcs, squares).
- Les petites cellules permettent de reporter le surplus de trafic des sites classiques sur elles, ce qui permet d’activer le mode veille plus efficacement.
- Le recours aux petites cellules évite la densification du réseau par l’installation de sites mobiles « classiques ». La discussion a été organisée par l’Arcep afin de réfléchir aux différents défis liés à la qualité de service, à l’accès aux réseaux et aux technologies de connectivité.
- Les participants ont évoqué notamment les problèmes liés à la sobriété énergétique et au déploiement des infrastructures environnementales.
- Ils ont insisté sur le besoin de multiplier les technologies de connectivité pour soutenir le numérique et permettre à l’utilisateur d’avoir une liberté plus grande. The complexity of the subject of network deployments today leads to a principle of openness (temporal, geographic net neutrality) that induces technical and legal discussions about the role for users in accessing and using the services and content of their choice.
-Participants noted that elected officials and representatives from municipalities were under strong pressure from populations and other businesses to improve connectivity in their territory. Operators, the role of encouragement and coercion, must juggle between different demands from consumers while still reducing energy consumption. Is responsibility for this decision ultimately borne by industry or consumers?
-The statement was tempered by noting that users often make choices based on convenience rather than considering the impact on others. The document discusses the fact that with new technologies, "individual responsibility should not be offering, marketing incentives and not supplant the state's role."
-Social norms that can only help to increase consumption were raised as important, and still unresolved issues.
-The participants were concerned about the government's ability to act directly on consumer behavior, and its impact on the environment and carbon emissions.
-Some participants wanted a more global perspective, questioning business models and environmental/social standards of companies.
-Some believed that there needed to be clear challenges set for what constitutes quality environmental and social products; while others lamented the lack of structural variables allowing private actors to act effectively and efficiently.
-Questions remain: should we reduce consumption of data? Usage? Or do we take more direct action on environmental impact and emissions from these usages? The workshop aimed to explore the links between cybersecurity and environ- ment, focusing on identifying several categories of questions that could be addressed. 
-The first category of questions focuses on how to better manage cyberrisk in relation to environmen- tal issues. This includes topics such as developing a “sustainable” digital world, beyond just the digital realm, and training professionals in order to convince decision makers that an absence of an organized cyberresponse could one day threaten their business or economic model. 
-The goal of this collaborative workshop was to explore the links between cybersecurity and environment, with a focus on identifying ways to improve our understanding of how these two domains intersect. 
-Group discussions enabled participants to share ideas and insights about various topics related to cybersecurity and environment. These included topics such as risk assessment, crisis management, ecosystem resilience, and building a sustainable digital future.

-Cybersécurité cannot rely on traditional security measures while still aiming for an ambitious goal of securing society and building trust. 
-The participants emphasized the need to explore synergies between cybersecurity and environmental transition, especially by promoting the emergence of innovative technologies that support both goals. 
-It is necessary to consider how crises affecting the environment might affect cyber risks such as an increase in malicious activity online or physical attacks on infrastructure (for example, overheating data centers during a hot summer season). Additionally, participants stressed the importance of exploring synergies between cybersecurity and other fields such as energy efficiency The document discusses approaches to developing a digital sustainable and secure, taking into account technical cooperation on this double approach. More specifically and in response to identified challenges, several action items were proposed: 
-Valorizing the risk-based approach by taking into account the cyber impacts on environmental risks and vice versa, without reducing the ambition in terms of security. 
-Developing education and sensibilization of actors in cyberspace security about environmental implications for part, so that a more sober cyber security emerges; 
-Initiation of a dialogue between public sector actors responsible for cybersecurity (e.g., ANSSI) and environment transition issues (e.g., ADEME). But also encouraging more generally initiatives by all actors of cyber and environment ecosystems, including at European and international levels. 
-Emerging a concept federative around « sustainable by design » (durable by design), which unites concepts of « security by design » and limitation «by design» of carbon footprint of envisaged projects. Full report from ANSSI included in annexes 35362.2 The Shift Project is a project by Ericsson, TiBCO, Facebook, and UFC Que Choisir aimed at improving the efficiency of digital services.
-The goal of the project is to shift away from traditional models of economic thinking in order to better serve customers.
-Some of the ways that this will be done include changing the models used for pricing and product development, as well as encouraging energy efficient design in terminals, services, and content.
-Another goal of the project is to improve measurement techniques so that providers can more accurately assess their performance.
-Finally, the aim is to provide users with clear information about their energy consumption so they can make informed decisions.
-The Shift Project was launched in 2017 and has already made some significant changes in the way digital services are delivered. "L’éco-conception des services numériques permet une intégration systématique des aspects environnementaux dès la conception et le développement de produits (biens et services, systèmes) avec pour objectif la réduction des impacts environnementaux tout au long de leur cycle de vie à service rendu équivalent ou supérieur."
- L'ADEME est chargée d'aider les entreprises à réduire les impacts environnementaux sur tout le cycle du produit.
- Le but est de rendre les produits équivalents ou supérieurs aux services existants sans impact environnemental. The document discusses the need for a low-carbon model for our country, and the systematic integration of environmental aspects convinced that the digital revolution can be a powerful force from conception and development of products (key lever to address environmental issues) with an aim to reducing the amounts confronted. 
- Environmental impacts occur throughout their lifecycle in equal or superior service rendered. Digital technologies, electronic progress offers numerous opportunities to be seized, immense possibilities. 
- The ADEME must develop an offer of products, goods, moving towards mutualization, sharing and optimization of digital and services high performance environmentally aware resources. This question of resources is at the heart of eco-design transition ecological approach's gracefulness. Financing businesses via our support schemes. These 50 last years, world population has more than doubled (3 billion people to 7 billion) while consumption of digital resources is increasingly important as 75% of environmental impact associated with technology manufacturing phase equipment. This contributes to circular economy and allows limiting waste production as well as "disrupting" many practices and models while in progress The document discusses new products and the sector of repair in particular, which is a productivist and predatory culture that can generate jobs that are less localized and more environmentally friendly.
-It is necessary to allow synergy between the two transitions, the transition to a digital world and the environmental transition, as both cannot be accomplished without cooperation from different actors.
-There are several axes of work for ADEME: understanding impacts on product use from digital technology, reducing energy consumption, resources usage, and greenhouse gas emissions; educating consumers on proper use of technologies; assessing environmental impact across all life stages of a product; developing metrics for multiple criteria.
-Evaluation of environmental impact requires an analysis of the entire life cycle of a product. Questions about over-equipment, frequency of use in an integrated approach. ADEME seeks to continue its renewal efforts by addressing these topics The document discusses ways to combat wasteful practices, which is important in developing responsible consumption. 
-One main focus is the use of digital tools for accelerating the transition to a more environmentally friendly technology. 
-Many practices are now possible with the use of digital tools and services, such as connecting people and businesses, accessing data, or computing power. 
-The goal is to gradually separate economic growth from resource consumption by using more efficient methods for consuming resources and using them more effectively. The document discusses how digital has benefited the economy in all sectors.
-We call for using digital's potential as a lever of environmental transition development, and its impact on product repair (due to increased connectivity).
-Organized workshops by the Arcep have been beneficial for complex products or services with an ecological design.
-It is also important to develop user information and understanding of digital's implications, so that users can be more responsible for their actions. 
-We believe that stakeholders need to establish consensus around digital boundaries and its key issues, which is essential for effective communication. 
-Measuring and sharing common understandings about digital usage among key actors is important in order to create responsible decisions. Durable constitue un levier pour l'objectivation de son impact et de ses avantages, notamment en termes d'ambitions claires et précises et de son potentiel.
- Dans ce cadre, nous soutenons l'instauration des critères objectifs et contrôlables afin que tous les acteurs du numérique développent des pratiques positives.
- Pour parvenir à un état des lieux complet sur les gains apportés par le numérique dans tous les secteurs, il est essentiel de mobiliser une surveillance de marché efficace.
- Une approche différenciée des acteurs économiques est nécessaire pour prendre en compte les spécificités du secteur du numérique.
- Au niveau français, la loi relative à l’impact environnemental du numérique a été adoptée en 2020. La lutte contre le gaspillage et à l’économie circulaire constitue une étape importante pour la rencontre des transitions numérique et écologique.
- L’AFNUM est impliquée dans de nombreux chantiers (indices réparabilité et durabilité, fonds réparation, fonds réemploi, pièces détachées, garantie, mises à jour logicielles…)
- Le plan d’action économie circulaire ou le nouvel agenda consommateur de la Commission européenne connaîtront en 2021 des traductions législatives européennes concrètes qu’il convient également d’intégrer.
- De manière générale, il nous semble impératif de ne pas négliger le soutien du cadre législatif existant dans les réflexions de pistes d’actions. The exercise is the evaluation of emissions this impact is made complex by the technicality of products, indirect emissions, for example transport, shopping and use in downstream. 
-The complexity of value chains, networks and uses. 
-Having ACV and detailed carbon accounting reports from all actors would help mitigate the lack of data. 
-A carbon footprint, for example to calculate indicators such as CO2eq levels, requires a number of assumptions that are difficult to verify. 
-Each result requires many assumptions and battle of numbers risks discrediting efforts by all industry sectors. It is clear that reliable information on carbon footprints will not be enough to reduce it: it is mainly consumer restraint, eco-design principles, a sustainable pace The document discusses the need for accurate and reliable assessments of the environmental impact of digital uses, including cycle-of-life analyses.

- Altitude thanks the Authority for this opportunity to discuss an important and relevant topic. At the same time, in order to address climate urgency immediately, Altitude remains available to speak on this issue. The document discusses ways in which the French government can participate beyond French borders in environmental groups focused on specific topics such as climate change.
-The Group Altitude shares the concerns of the Authority and allows those involved to exchange or define public powers concerning the effects of climate change in order to advance collectively as a sector.
-Many actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions seem to have been forgotten, while mobile and digital usage is only a small part of overall emissions.
-It is probable that networked technologies such as smart cars or all electric vehicles will constitute a significant share of emissions in the future. Le groupe Altitude souhaite encourager l’optimisation des déplacements des techniciens afin de réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre.
- Le Groupe Altitude estime que le numérique ne doit être vu qu’à travers son impact environnemental positif, et notamment sa contribution à la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre.
- Afin d’évaluer précisément l’impact du numérique sur le réchauffement climatique, il convient que l’Autorité prenne en compte les cycles de vie des objets numériques. The document discusses the need for land to be cleared in order for infrastructure to be built, exploited and commercialized, with a focus on physical aspects such as networks, technologies, electronic communication networks, primarily where terminals are located.
-The literature on this topic is flourishing and has already begun to provide insights into fiber optic usage which shows the variety and complexity of impacts on populations across their entirety.
-Other mobilizations focus on environmental issues from resource consumption to energy needs.
-The Avicca federation of municipalities that aim to benefit the greatest number of digital contributions aims to participate in discussions concerning its environmental impact. This is manifested in their desire to take part in shaping digital policy The document discusses the need for partnerships with private sector actors specifically focused on this topic of prospective management.
-44BÉATRICE BELLINI is a Master in Management Sciences, University Paris Nanterre and responsible for the Positive Business 85 Chaire.
-The second point is that the relevance of the proposed solutions to reduce impacts during the sanitary crisis should be taken into account. 
-However, it can be difficult to produce sustainable products while keeping ownership of the final product. This will lead to developing actions that harm company profitability and sustainability over time. 
-The economic model most likely to decouple social and environmental impacts is often isolated from other economic functions as we are living in a finite world. It is also called circular economy economics, where social and environmental considerations are integrated within a functional capability. 
-It can be difficult for producers to maintain long term economic interests while maintaining ownership of their product. This will lead to reconsidering relationships between producers and consumers The document discusses the importance of integrating into a single system in order to be effective.
-The model should be efficient, but it's also important to consider how the use of digital data will impact energy consumption.
-There are many challenges involved in transitioning to a sustainable business model, including increasing energy consumption; improving management practices (finance, marketing, strategy…) to generate more profits; and developing an understanding of digital sustainability. 
-Two points that need to be considered when designing a sustainable business model are valuing social and environmental efforts made by the organization and formalizing these values clearly in product or service offerings so that customers can make informed decisions about price. 
-This approach to marketing is compatible with the evolution of technology. The document discusses the need for marketeers to be more responsible and push their positions not only due to regulations, but also the expectations of citizens. 
-A training program for marketers to learn about these concepts is essential in order for them to compete effectively. 
-45 -The number given refers to a study that was published in 2016. 
-85 -This refers to a target that the operators have set themselves in order to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases by 50% by 2030. 
-Despite their efforts, the operators will not be able to reduce drastically their emissions of greenhouse gases and at the same time increase the capacity of their networks to meet customer demand, which is partly due to companies adopting more environmentally conscious behaviors (e.g., teleworking). 
-Climate change and its effects on our ecosystems The operators must take part as well. They are facing threats that call for swift measures. Environmental efficiency is at the heart of the response system, with digital already being integrated into it through two requirements: first, that it be present throughout an organization; and second, that it play an active role in strategic planning. It should also be noted that environmental efficiency should go beyond just reducing environmental impact; it should aim at creating value as well (for example, through recycling or directing resources towards smart buildings or smart cities). 
-In this context, it is obvious that digital technology must play an important role The question of sustainability of specialized European filières. The digital cannot be appraised separately. It must include all filières with which interactions exist, as regards mobile terminals next, Bouygues Telecom in particular to appreciate the ecological gains and costs of work over the past decade with Recommerce, a global player. This is how the system as a whole it is necessary to recondition France. This partnership analyze it weighing, if necessary, the increase in users' devices (nearly 2 million today).
- emphasis is also put on lengthening the life of smartphones by means of recycling them by successive users. Despite their efforts, which are manifested for example by introducing more efficient technologies (FTTH vs xDSL, 5G vs 4G), operators will at the same time be able to reduce drastically 
-Ultimately, if digital must Necessarily work their emissions of greenhouse gases and, in the same time, reduce its environmental impact, the tools that could increase the capacity of their networks to respond to demand should be deployed to guide his effort should avoid always stronger demands from their customers, caused by a "silo" approach that ignores other parts by adopting by society behaviors more comprehensive of the problem. This requirement is necessary sober (for example, teleworking) 
- First within the sector, to ensure an equitable distribution among all actors 
- It is clear that a policy of sobriety with positive externalities would only apply to operators and would not be fully ecological for other sectors and, in addition, would not forget effective and worsen existing imbalances. 
- As regards ambition, it must be borne in mind that he has set as one of his priorities the organization future of our society. GSMA is proposing that the digital sector emits 1g of CO2 per year, which could avoid 10g of emissions from other sectors. 
- This report is only 1-3 according to other studies. 
- 46 87. If each new generation of technology shows less impact on transport than the previous one (according to our observations, between 5G and 4G), annual growth in network usage will inevitably lead to increased energy consumption by our networks. 
- 88. Bouygues Telecom cites the Arcep "Terminals, weak link in internet opening" report, February 2018 as an example. 
- The CGDD believes that although awareness of the environmental impact of digitalization is beginning to take hold, it needs to be better understood, evaluated and controlled now. 
 - The convergence of digital and ecological transitions are major challenges for the 21st century and must be met through responsible use of information technology... The document discusses the ways in which digital technologies are impacting the environment, and how private sector actors must continue to invest in order to ensure a seamless deployment of these technologies in line with our environmental and social goals.
-It will require mobilizing AI's potential for more environmentally friendly use of energy, as well as optimizing its use in all aspects of the transition to a low carbon world.
-In terms of economic impact, the Ministry of Transition is also working with its partners (DINUM, DGE, DAE) to reduce environmental impacts associated with digital development while also preserving biodiversity. 
-The ministry supports research and projects that go towards this goal. For example, emissions from digital technology have increased since 2013 by about... 450 million tonnes in the OECD, while global emissions have decreased by 250MtCO2eq. Although recent, the collective consciousness of the environmental impact of digitalization is starting to develop. This impact needs to be better understood, evaluated and, now more than ever, managed. 
- The CLCV demands a return to the principle of sobriety through an study of adapted means for reducing energy consumption and circular economy. 
- 5G represents a significant turning point in digital development; if professionals' constant pressure towards the digital world and consumer demand creates new needs for high-speed mobile networks, it will also have positive effects on sustainability. 
- The fight against digital fracture seems relegated to a secondary role in this context. The document discusses the issue of wastefulness in our current digital age and how it has led to a growing fracture between electronic equipment.
-The passage on still being difficult to accept is especially relevant in light of 5G's potential to exacerbate local problems. 
-The CLCV believes that compatibility and disposal of old electronics should be part of the goal of 5G, not its opposite. 
-There is a lack of long term data on the effects of 5G on health, so the CLCV calls for constant vigilance. Régulation: The document discusses the importance of regulation in regards to the digital space, and how honored it is that citizens and regulators have been able to collaborate on this. 
- Car elles permettent d’éclairer Gouvernement sur le numérique: The document says that one of the benefits of having car elles is that the government can get insights about the digital space from them. 
- Aussi, le Conseil a accompagné cette à la réflexion de l’ARCEP sur le numérique et l’environnement: The council also helped with this discussion by accompanying it to the ARCEP's reflection on the digital and environmental environment. 
- feuille de route d’un avis sur les données environnementales d’intérêt général: This document is called a "roadmap" and it contains 50 proposals designed collaboratively with more than fifty interministerial strategies for the digital and environmental environment. 
- dans lequel il est proposé que les données À la suite d’une saisine de la ministre de la Transition écologique et environnementales soient considérées comme des données solidaire et du secrétaire d’État chargé du Numérique: It is proposed that data after being requested by the Minister for Ecology and Environment be considered as collective data and under the responsibility of Secretary of State for Digital Affairs. 
- Le Conseil d’intérêt général et constituent ainsi une brique de la transition national du numérique, en partenariat avec le Haut Conseil pour écologique et solidaire: The Council of Interest General also constitutes a cornerstone of France's national transition to digitalization, working together with High Council for Ecological Solidarity. The Conseil national du numérique has published a roadmap for reducing the environmental impact of digital technologies, with 2030 as the target year for achieving zero net emissions of greenhouse gases without compensating measures.
- The second project, Chantier 2, is focused on developing eco-friendly and sustainable applications for digital technologies.
- Project 3, aimed at creating a toolkit to support transnational environmental goals, was presented to the Minister of Ecology in July 2020.
- In October last year, the Conseil national du numérique released a report recommending that data be made available for public interest purposes. The document discusses the strategy of interministerial cooperation to develop a digital footprint and reduce environmental impact in France.
-The strategy includes three axes: 
-Developing knowledge about the environmental impact of digital transformation 
-Reducing the environmental impact of digital transformation 
-Making digital transformation an effective tool for ecological transition. Questionner la nécessité de chaque innovation au vu de l’urgence plusieurs infrastructures réseaux différentes en parallèle.
- Un seul climatique dans laquelle nous sommes est essentiel !
- Pour rappel, l’opérateur public ou sous statut de SCIC serait garant de l’intérêt collectif.
- Or, le moratoire sur la 5G proposé par la CCC a été enterré par le gouvernement. The "democratic approach" to this process of consultation.
-No. 
-To be able to drive a self-driving car? No.
-4) Break with strategies focused on "sensibilization" of the consumer: visual focus? No. 
-In light of the exchanges, it is likely that he will immerse very deeply into these issues related to "consumer responsibility": 
-connecting people between themselves using tools for or indirectly through environmental policies for a number of years. This reversal of responsibilities prevents taking real structural measures in line with the challenges we are facing. The reliability indicator is yet another demonstration of this bias. Thinking that it is enough to have clear information to change consumer demand and thereby influence (quickly) production methods is unrealistic. A drastic regulation of digital advertising on products, extending warranty coverage for 5 years for electronic products, or even the normalization of parts detached for their interoperability / retrocompatibility: these are just some examples of responsible measures.

-I will not return to discuss social or environmental impacts research. I will not discuss the interest of deploying ARCEP or ADEME to oversee and carry it to a level where society is digitally 
-Others have done this before me and it would be helpful if there was European support for social and scientific forces. France should contribute more than this in summarizing.
-What? We're going to get nowhere fast. We also need, once these enter into an era of action, a period when data on negative impacts of technology exist, that they are accessible to citizens, decision makers considered essential for the general public and entrepreneurs. 
-I advocate institutionalization - everyone needs to do it. This prerequisite is the only one capable of overseeing, through a voluntary approach leading to timely results in our organizations, the following steps in avoiding harm and defining a framework for thinking, policies and actions around reducing negative digital impact benefits almost exclusively for a responsible digital world. A structured approach based on exclusive use of leverage mechanisms that allows without betraying trust an approach CMERC - meaning Understand->Measure->Avoid-. 
-Reducing->Compensating. After more than 10 years of effort we finally Succeeded with an act motivated by disinterest like what Institute du Numérique Responsable has done The document discusses the negative effects of digital technologies, specifically how they are a pharmakon or poison as described by Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler.
-Now we move on to measure. Measurement is a prerequisite for action, and it is at the root of everything. I'm always surprised to see people get involved in environmental activism without knowing their annual carbon emissions or how far they've moved their car in terms of energy consumption over the course of a year. Often, we try to hide behind the famous "it depends on the car" excuse. Of course, this is true in theory, but this pursuit of exact numbers inhibits action - especially given that online data errors are very common. We'll have to pass over this search for perfection, which doesn't correspond to anything and often represents an excuse for delaying engagement. Let's work collaboratively using scientific and serious methods to determine major trends and average values. 
-The deployment represents our first step in reducing our carbon emissions; it emits 62% of our total CO2 emissions. Fiber also allows for better network utilization by connecting mobile sites together The connected objects of Covage's service to our clients who are active constitutes the intelligent territories. 
-The second emission point of Covage through electric consumption of network equipment. 
-One year ago, Covage wanted to include environmental responsibility as one of its core activities, and 
-Transportation represents the third emission point. The car remains the mode of transport with the most significant contribution with an important role to play. 
-Less than 2 tons CO2 per year per employee. So that everyone can judge the impact of their different practices and because it is important to know where we come from, an estimated CO2 emissions report for 2019 was prepared according to 4 axes (transports, waste, water consumption and energy use), and is subject to monthly tracking within Covage's internal platform for ride sharing, the acquisition of hybrid vehicles, a strengthened treatment of construction site wastes. Before even the health crisis struck, our employees were eligible for two days work per week and for video conferencing facilities at 21 sites throughout France. The transport section identifies CO2 emissions according to transportation modes in Covage's activities. The sharing of good practices: environmental charter, Two indicators also allow us to follow the part played by people Covage se réjouit de la démarche initiée par l’ARCEP pour la sensibilisation au changement climatique.
- La section déploiement trace nos émissions liées au transport construire ensemble un numérique soutenable et salue l’innovation du matériel (câbles en fibre optique principalement) et aux de sa plateforme participative, ouverte et riche de sa diversité.
- La section a donc vocation à disparaitre une fois nos réseaux déployés. L’obsolescence logicielle est souvent liée à une interaction étroite entre le software et le hardware.
-Par exemple, le BIOS est une clef dans la maintenance des serveurs au data centers.

-The CSA Council Superior of Audiovisuals has issued a report stating that video online would account for 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to Spain. 
-Studies have been conducted in connection with the creation of a radiophone sectoral center, as well as in relation to environmental impacts associated with digital media usage. The CSA intends to take part in public debate on the impact of audiovisuals on the environment through its various components - production, distribution and consumption - and television's individual listening duration has now reached 3 hours and 30 minutes per day, while radio is listened to daily for 40.9 million101 people. These digital media usage trends underscore strong and renewed interest among French citizens for audiovisual media usage since the start of the health crisis, adding to internet streaming's growing market share. 
-Streaming video accounts for 60% of global internet traffic volume growth over the past year The development of the internet will continue to enrich itself year after year.
-High-speed networks and the continuing growth of connected devices within homes: in 1st quarter 2020, 86% of households were equipped with a computer and 77% of those aged 11 or older had a smartphone.
-On 2020, French people watched on average 6.6 hours of online video per week, an increase of 8.1% over 2019. This represents 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to Spain’s 300 million tonnes CO2 annually emitted, while energy consumption for digital media grows 9% annually. This commitment cannot be accelerated fast enough and several action levers have already been identified with the ambition to act, firstly by cooperating with all relevant stakeholders in the sector and secondly by appealing to consumers, online video networks being a powerful tool for disseminating information and sensitizing citizens. The digital impact is a topic of debate even among different groups 
-Other than interface issues, it is also important to include scenarios for using digital tools into the discussion 
-However, the fight against environmental pollution and quality content remains the same regardless of whether it is material or energy related. A part of digital problems are related to design challenges, specifically ecoconception. It is now that we have to think about our virtual future. This includes aspects such as energy consumption when browsing the internet but also data storage and transfer phases. As a designer of online services and digital content, it is necessary to take into account both environmental and social impacts of our virtual production. This includes not only aspects related to graphic design, such as calculating energy consumption when creating graphics, but also developers responsible for creating websites and user interfaces Ericsson is urging for a more sustainable digital future and believes that infrastructure and terminal exchanges should be open to each other in order to improve efficiency.
-There is an increasing number of data transfers that are becoming more energy intensive, leading to devices outperforming for superficial content and also being optimized.
-55% of Ericsson's employees believe that the technology industry has a responsibility to society, which goes beyond just technology advancements. 4 dimensions - such as platforms for work - are particularly important in shaping the ecosystem. 
-Ericsson would like to thank ARCEP for launching its "Sustainable Digital Future" initiative. They believe that 5G will have a positive impact on the environment by reducing network consumption while not increasing carbon emissions. 
-A wider discussion about network architecture is needed, along with new functions such as power management and limiting consumption. The document discusses the global impact of artificial intelligence on the environment.
-The first dimension of the impact is on the environment itself, and it concerns the effects of digital technology on climate change.
-The second dimension is on the potential benefits of digital technology, such as increased efficiency and convergence across different sectors.
-We acknowledge the importance of the issue, but we also think that action needs to be taken quickly in order to avoid risks. However, we believe that effective action requires a combination of both urgency and pragmatism. The different stakeholders consider 5G as an asset that should best serve our usages or even various technologies. These needs, estimating the possible rebound effects and are also keen because the respective impacts are prospective to imagine the actions to eliminate or limit them. Often complex to analyze: evaluation of the impact of streaming on consumption is not immediate since most energy consumed by networks is fixed and does not depend on traffic. Mobile network consumes less per subscriber but fixed is more efficient in bits transmitted; WiFi is often seen as an interesting solution but WiFi routers are rarely turned off at night (and more connected objects in a home, like heating and security, make people less likely want it turned off, even during the night or absences …). Mobile network allows mobility-based usages become part of our daily lives and offers a lower cost coverage in rural or remote areas. 

-According to International Energy Agency104, technologies 1,5% des émissions empreinte écologique des services numériques est en fait liée de carbone dans le monde.
-Les initiatives visant à mettre en place des services numériques d’approvisionnement, et de nous associer à d’autres pour élaborer durables devraient donc se concentrer avant tout sur ces défis, et partager des solutions de lutte contre le changement où se trouvent les plus grandes possibilités de réduction de climatique.
-Dès 2011, Facebook a été l’une des premières entreprises technologiques à s’engager à utiliser une énergie renouvelable. Aujourd’hui, grâce aux progrès de la technologie, les centres d’IA pour optimiser la consommation d’énergie ne consomment qu’environ 1 % de carbone. The need to move due to the use of electricity, even though internet traffic has tripled
- As declared by the Commissioner since 2015 and that European center of data work charges in the internal market Thierry Breton: «The improvement of - a measure of demand for services - have more than doubled105. connectivity high-speed [...] will allow us to connect more objects and process more data to better understand our energy consumption and reduce emissions by 15% over the next decade».
- Regarding online services, progress made in other sectors has been particularly remarkable for videos and messages. At Facebook, we developed our own video compression technology and use an adaptive bitrate technique to optimize resolution of a video.
- The best way to limit carbon footprint of digital services is concentrating on main source of unintentional usage, i.e., mobile devices. We automatically reduce quality of videos when pollution levels are high: production and recycling of terminals used involuntarily. These measures contribute to reducing battery consumption and making digital services more durable today very low energy consumer. For online services, 

the most sustainable way to use resources is focusing on main user behavior patterns such as autoplay feature being turned off when device is not charged fully Messenger is a messaging app, for example, which is two times faster to start up and uses one fourth of the size of the EU’s strategy aimed at reducing carbon footprint of its predecessor, using thus less energy and space.

The document discusses how digital technologies have an environmental impact and how operators need to take measures at the heart of our daily use patterns, in education systems, in our social lives, and also be responsible for sustainable development practices. It also highlights the extent to which companies' sustainability commitments have been made public since the health crisis revealed just how much digital technologies are impacting our health today. Operators must urgently adopt approaches that are central to our daily lives as well as those that are socially responsible and environmentally friendly; they should also be aligned with employees' RSE commitments The deployment of 5G is only just beginning, and it will take years to provide this service to the largest population.
-While many rural territories do not have a number of 5G towers, new offers and replacements for consumers' terminals are multiplying.
-5G promises faster speeds and is already available, but it may be misleading to consumers and the digital sector is carrying major responsibility in guiding people in their choices so they can be the actors of a sustainable digital society.
-We expect all actors in the digital sphere to take responsibility for informing consumers about the effective coverage based on objective data that shows actual speeds observed, including inclusive speeds, and to ensure that everyone has access to a speed that meets their needs. The document discusses measures to increase the minimum broadband speed promised in the broadband plan, which is 8 megabits per second (Mbps).
-The health crisis has only made more clear the lack of an ADSL quality service, depriving families of being able to ensure compatibility among various electronic equipment and work from home, school-to-home or even online shopping during confinement. 
-Financing the broadband education plan dedicated to sobriety requires that we liberate operators of digital technology and allow for less regulation of usage. 
-128kbps to 512kbps should be the minimal threshold for content providers, including advertising agencies, as well as producers and distributors of high-speed content. 
-The responsibility for this impact on environment falls squarely on those in charge of digital media. Families Rurales asks the public powers: 
-To pass a legislative or regulatory definition defining what family rurales means; 
-To establish an index score for carbon emissions that would allow consumers to take into account their individual impact when making purchases; 
-"Content providers" should use technologies and practices oriented towards reducing consumption, ecological sustainability, informing users about their carbon footprint with an index score score Carbon index and regulating usage which would be entrusted to approved consumer defense associations sustainable financially.

- L’urgence est donc à la sobriété en données. (…) L’idée d’une taxe carbone aux frontières a été évoquée : pourquoi pas une taxe sur les données ?
- Les destinées à faire consommer plus ; ou encore des (jeux) vidéos jeunes de 20 ans auront alors 50 ans. Il est désormais largement montant sans cesse en résolution. Une telle législation ouvrirait reconnu que le numérique est sur la mauvaise trajectoire : c’est peut-être la voie aux projets les plus sobres en données – tels le secteur dont la croissance des émissions est la plus rapide. Sobriety in data is important, but the agenda of the digital economy is opposite: everywhere, there is talk only of "the new black" - products and services that are marketed to a large audience, such as a 5G phone and an 8K TV, data. The economic stakes are much higher than simply producing these products in large quantities. 
- This raises the problem of transparency: it's difficult for companies or citizens to be open about their strategies when prospecting for resources underground, something that fossil fuels have been able to do for a long time. 
- Environmental impact is displaced and not reduced by this behavior. It's shifted away from citizens or NGOs who would use it more responsibly. This presents an economic major challenge that is similar to what has happened with fossil fuel divestment. The most voracious people don't see the day also pose problems with sovereignty, which are not insoluble.
-In 2020, the theme of digital responsible and sustainable transitions will be "the health crisis has revealed 
-Among its attributes, the digital has a strong voice in public markets...The list is long and initiatives to consider environmental considerations, in line with the explosion of many electronic devices but already there is an urgency to make quickly use of digital technologies, the proliferation of electronic equipment and a collective operationally operational 
- The document discusses the rise in gamification and the abundance of data. In this area, vast fields of ecological data. reflections are opening to define collectively the foundations of a sustainable digital economy. In this definition, urban territories have a strong voice, legitimate because of their skills and responsibilities, but also because existing digital uses and services exist in them all. This axis is well placed on local executive's agendas, as evidenced by the political will and porting of cities and metropolitan areas. This sequence of reflections coincides with an institutional sequence strong in the implementation of a " territorialization" process, in the development plan for France's relaunch, more broadly speaking in the assertion of public policies related to ecology. In the long term, setting up local governance for digital affairs will allow for a more effective and equitable penetration of digital technologies into territories, which will federate together not only city governments' voices but also those of state institutions, European institutions, local businesses' representatives... A decision-aiding tool, it will be beneficial for stimulating action priorities and identifying funding possibilities while interterritorial cooperation can be expressed through digital public policies. Above all, measures and initiatives aimed at sustainable digital management and responsible use can integrate into development goals (SDGs)and various environmental plans put in place by local institutions.]

-The growth in emissions from electronic sector emissions comes mostly from increased use 
of technology rather than new sources being created 
-A strong focus on local governance is important to help make decisions about how best to use technology within specific contexts 
-This approach would also benefit from closer ties between different levels of government The document discusses the environmental impacts of technology, in particular, the impacts of electronic devices and data centers.
- The main growth area for emissions from ICT sectors is imports from connected devices to better manage their environmental impact: TVs, computers, etc.
- One of the priority objectives for public authorities should be to measure this impact with precision and objectivity. The unpublished detailed elements below, demonstrating that telecoms are a key sector to face environmental challenges.

-The study by Arthur D. Little's cabinet of consulting will be presented at the FFT Telecoms' press conference on December 15th.

-These performance results are the result of actions taken by telecom operators for years, both on networks and terminal equipment.

-Furthermore, telecoms have an essential role in meeting environmental challenges by contributing positively to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from other industrial sectors. The figures presented above confirm that most growth in greenhouse gas emissions from digital sectors comes from imported equipment connected to networks (mainly TV, computers, etc.) and data centers hosting content (primarily GAFAN). This explains why it is important for all players in the digital ecosystem – including and especially global giants – to take responsible steps forward with a more sustainable digital future. Any new regulatory framework must take into account the relevant level – at least European – for not imposing burdens only on national actors and triggering displacement or transfer effects. The constant effort put into place by telecoms needs to be complemented with new action levers introduced by other electricity tariff categories for data centers - but which could also apply to network equipment. The document discusses the risk of contradictory government actions between issues of digital sovereignty and industrial relocation and the issue of reducing energy-intensive activities. 
-62France has a durable city strategy that considers "ACV solutions for territorial resilience and urban sustainability, which is a standardized multidisciplinary cycle life product approach (ISO 14040 and 14044)") to better understand the real relevance of their use and especially their impact. 
-The use of digital tools is an obvious asset in dealing with rare earths: understanding how to use them strategically to mobilize global stocks of rare earths is a major geopolitical issue. Today, systemic approaches, strengthening system-based approaches, mobilizing global stocks of rare earths, are all focused on China more broadly taking into account stakeholder participation. However, this last provides 90% of world needs for industry. 
-The electronic recycling sector is complex and still in its infancy; electronic waste requires specific knowledge about how to recycle it. However, it is often presented as the new recycling technique that is being studied. Rare earths are not scarce because there are limited stocks but because they are dependent on materials and rare earths whose extraction harms ecosystems and which are owned by other countries (China). The document discusses the environmental impacts of digital production, and how it has led to massive new vulnerabilities in terms of resilience against industrial chain-related risks, but also due to natural or man-made disasters that can cause disruptions in supply chains.

-The growth of demand for rare metals (like neodymium) is causing unprecedented levels of environmental damage, with annual growth rates reaching 2500%. 

-The use of digital technologies facilitates the transfer and sharing of data, as well as the reduction in prices. This is a key tool in anticipating phenomena such as cyber security threats or urban and territorial fragmentation. 

-A standardized life cycle approach for products made with digital technologies must be taken into account (ISO 14040 and 14044). They are also sensitive to events leading to power outages... The use of approximations is useful, it allows consumers and producers to be involved. They
-In order to discuss the impact of the digital on ecosystems, it is important to note that they can be used mainly in cases where two systems with the same functions are being compared. In 2019, around 4% of global carbon emissions are due to digital production and use, compared to 2% for air transport and 8% for energy consumption. 
-Every year, 50 million tonnes of waste are generated as a result of new computer and electronic equipment development; this is an annual improvement in energy efficiency of 20%. 
-The development of the digital has led to an increase in energy intensity by 20% annually. The document discusses ways to ensure economic opportunity for France.
-The key is to have reliable information, and the focus must be on sustainable practices.
-France and Europe are still key in terms of national independence in terms of hosting data centers.
-There is a lack of legal certainty for all businesses, which is inevitable with the growth of the digital age.
-The GIMELEC is happy to see a real realization among French businesses about this issue, as the digital economy opens up new possibilities but also brings new environmental and energy challenges. 
-A holistic view is needed when dealing with the intersection of these different aspects of the digital age. Le GIMELEC est un groupement des entreprises de la filière électronumérique en France.

-L’attente est forte pour que l’on parle de réglementations manquantes le risque d’avoir une approche rapide qui aurait un impact négatif sur l’indépendance numérique de la France et de l’Europe. Google is the largest private buyer of environmental impact throughout its entire renewable energy cycle, allowing it to buy life, its energy efficiency, resources used, etc. 
-Since 2007, Google has been buying renewable energy resources equivalent to 100% of its global electricity consumption. 
-Google aims to use recycled materials and renewable energy sources in at least 50% of the plastic used in its range of products by 2025. 
-Compared to 5 years ago, Google's data centers are able to provide 7 times more computing power while using the same amount of electricity. 
-Google plans to eliminate plastic packaging using the same amount of electric power by 2025. By using machine learning, it was possible to reduce the amount of plastic used in Google's packaging by 50%. Google se concentre sur la réduction des déchets en produisant des centres de données qui n’utilisent pas d’énergie pour refroidir

- Pour ce faire, YouTube offre aux utilisateurs une expérience optimale et gratuite avec l’option de lecture automatique
- Google s'engage à continuer d'étendre ses services de gestion de fin de vie The document discusses ways to be more mindful of how we use YouTube and to set healthy habits for the whole family. 
-The main points are that YouTube is a non-renewable resource and that it is important to be mindful of how we use it, and also to protect our privacy and access to essential services. 
-The goal is to make sure everyone has access to good quality internet connections without overspending on technology or compromising our ethics. The planet. To do this, we need to deploy the networks simply, it is about saving digital resources intelligently, optimised in accordance with the needs that don't harm living things while we conceive them, but can be answered otherwise It's also about calming our manufacturing and using them. Consumer voracity is the main obstacle to avoiding a "digital crunch" 

- Digital sobriety is the fundamental basis of a responsible digital world, both environmentally and socially. The respect for life is a powerful tool for innovation 

- Our studies over the past 15 years, at all levels - world , business 119 France118, enterprise119 service 120 have shown that using electronic equipment wisely has great environmental impacts. The main impact of digital technology on the environment takes place primarily during production of electrical equipment and during end-of-life management measures . That is, what we do with our smartphones and computers once they're turned on has only a marginal impact on the ground 

- Nevertheless, if one looks only at networks or data storage centers, it becomes clear that using their equipment is more important than their manufacture (up to 2 times more for data). The document is about the importance of reducing consumption of digital content. 
- The goal is to generalize ecoconception in services and teaching it in schools. 
- There needs to be more reuse of technology through directives such as a European Union eco-design directive, mandatory recall and reconsidering job retraining programs 
- Extended warranty laws need to be strengthened 
- Users need to have more control over software updates 
- International standards should be used The document is about the digital desecration of cultural goods, and how the Hadopi has de-materialized (based on French internet users aged 15 years and older – implemented since 2011 a consumption survey of 5002 individuals) 
- The 2020 edition was an opportunity to interrogate for the first time the internet users on their environmental perception of their cultural usage. 
- It emerged that nearly half of all internet users consider the environmental impact of their online cultural consumption: 43% say that using the internet to consume products from culture has a strong impact on environment, and especially in terms of carbon footprint. This perception is stronger for young people: 55% of 15-24 year olds consider this impact as strong or very strong, while 38% of 40 year olds or more do so.
Figure 1: Perception of the environmental impact of online cultural consumption by age group (based on French internet users aged 15 years and older – 5002 individuals) 
Answer to question: Are you inclined to consume less content from digital cultures? The document discusses the impact of digital culture on the environment, and how consumers are becoming more aware of the consequences of their own digital practices.
-According to the survey, 66% of internet users say they can be encouraged to consume less digital cultural products due to their energy consumption implications. This proportion reaches 73% among those who consider online consumption of cultural products to have a strong impact. However, only 69% of those aged 15-24 agree with this sentiment. 
-The sector responsible for 4% of all environmental damage is at the origin of this awareness 80% of the environmental impact from HOP is attributed to the phase of manufacturing 
- The introduction of a software design guideline by the AGEC law will help increase the durability of digital products 
- It is important to consider a product's ecological footprint when designing it, and also to promote recycling and repair techniques for electronic equipment
- It is necessary to develop a system that tracks product usage and collects data on how long products last HOP calls for actively fighting against software obsolescence, and including the concept of software obsolescence in the definition of planned obsolescence. 
-Two types of software obsolescence affect electronic equipment: material and functional. 
-Material obsolescence is caused by the hardware's fragility, and results in consumers having to replace their devices more often, and the environmental impact being reduced. 
-Functional obsolescence is due to the fact that software updates become incompatible with older versions of devices, or that new features are added but old ones removed. 
-HOP recommends separating corrective updates from performance updates, so that users can choose which they want without affecting their device's security. 
-The Anti-Gaspillage Law and a circular economy allow companies to refuse updates, but this can prove counterproductive if the user is held responsible. The document discusses the need for compliance, as well as the importance of allowing for reversibility of software updates. It appears necessary to ensure that consumers have clear information about the impacts on device functionality and applications in case of software updates. It is important to require greater transparency concerning product life cycles, 68 123.

- Les professionnels de la culture sont démunis : ils n’ont ni les moyens, ni les compétences pour penser et mettre en œuvre une politique de sobriété numérique. 
- La crise sanitaire tend à rabattre les usages culturels vers le numérique (cloud gaming, SVOD) et incite à développer des expériences en ligne, accroissant par là-même leur empreinte écologique. The European Union's Lille Metropolitan Area (MEL) promotes any form of mutualization of networks to ensure a rational and sustainable use of its territory. 
-In the preamble, the MEL applauds the participatory approach taken by the Authority with regard to its work on "A digital waste management strategy" 
-The MEL through its new Climate Plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2023. In Air Energy Territorial, it places environmental issues at the heart of practical considerations, which should result in new actions being taken in connection with land planning, prevention, reorganizing collection systems, developing technology infrastructure partnerships and increasing recycling and reuse rates. 
-The MEL promotes any form of mutualization of networks to ensure a rational and sustainable use of its territory. The MEL is also pleased with the implementation of a 4G network shared by all operators in Lille metro since 2014. This demonstrates once again the importance of mutualization for efficient communication The Mel believes that promoting an architecture of multi-operator projects. The Mel would like to see this decentralized network approach closer to users with a model extended dense area, where the interests of competition should be weighed against geographical conditions often weak infrastructure. It is worth noting that temperature and the need for cooling in urban centers constraint furniture use. The band 26 GHz will make this practice unavoidable. The MEL will harmonize and oversee access to urban furniture its territory, particularly conditions relating to energy adductions and candle management. However, it considers it more efficient and easy to accelerate copper decommissioning networks than to turn off old mobile networks for which many still have uses. However, the Mel remains 

However, the Mel believes that promoting an architecture of multi-operator projects is necessary in order to improve coordination between users and promote sustainable digital behaviors. In addition, the Mel supports Arcep's proposal "House of Technology" - voice of the ARCEP - defining a national plan for prevention of digital addiction. Pour accompagner l’accès aux services, la MEL souhaite rappeler le programme national des tiers-lieux numériques et son importance.
- L’impact des services numériques est important, et il est nécessaire de contribuer pour respecter les engagements environnementaux. The document discusses the development of an approach to ACV as a decision criterion and digital reasoned, with conscious and mastered usages, labeling. Appropriate means and optimized services. The consideration of user usages and means obliges treating digital services in their entirety, through service rendered to users Additionally, since 2010, France and Europe have established (functional approach). the Analysis of Cycle Life as an essential support for public awareness and communication towards the environmental impact of goods produced using De facto, a design for sustainability must take into account both physical and IT/virtualized equipment. This is why PEF/OEF is likely to be the preferred approach covering all elements constituting these digital services (including terminals, networks, data centers), in addition to environmental impacts associated with online services at human resources associated levels (comprehensive approach). 

-It is necessary to move towards a life cycle from resource extraction through manufacture to harmonization of methods and data in order to allow for (resource exhaustion, energy consumption, homogeneity across studies results and comparability among results), up to end-of-life management (debris disposal). These are multifactorial impacts related to digital services; they have an influence on the entire cycle of life. More broadly, it is necessary to advance towards a life cycle where everything from resource extraction through production can be harmonized so that products can be designed more efficiently (using fewer resources while avoiding pollution), down to product disposal (managing waste). The equivalents of the issues. In a sector that makes use of distribution (fuel consumption) and equipment with multiple localizations and (electricity consumption,). It is therefore necessary to take into account the application in driving across a wide range of sectors in all stages of life-cycle of equipment (approach fields of society (energy, industry, entertainment, health…) multiple steps). than digital services, it is important to have precise and uniform reference standards allowing simplification of environmental studies.

Digital services are causing environmental impacts and strategic guidance reliable. Many 
In the context of the NégaOctet project, we propose to address identified issues as planetary limits are partly due to these different problems by providing access to generated by digital services, such as climate change methods and data conforming to international climate standards, water consumption, or chemical pollution levels that are also important human issues such as actors in the sector of digital services on resource consumption. All these expert works aimed at reinforcing and facilitating these issues should be taken into account (multicriteria approach).

The use of ACV will enable taking into account environmental impacts more comprehensively and precisely. Territoire: Includes territories that are already integrated into an equitable and sustainable approach. 
- Solutions Internet Haut Débit par Satellite allow for speeds of up to 2 Mbps. 
- Attention and awareness must be given to products and connections with speeds of 30 or 50 Mb/s in specific areas, taking into account the duration of use. 
- The mix-technological approach of the Diminution of Consumption plan should also take into account Boxes and peripheral devices (e.g., routers) with features such as programmability of LED lights to turn off at a certain time during the day. 
- Consistent with principles outlined below, reducing consumption is achieved by modifying service offerings without replacing equipment. These are the same products we were able to evolve without changing them. Les forfaits adaptés aux besoins des clients sont proposés.
- Les débits disponibles pour les services de 40 Mb/s en 2020 sont garantis.
- Les abonnements illimités consomment beaucoup d’énergie.

- La mise en place d’un kit satellite ne nécessite pas de déploiement d’infrastructure au sol complexe OVHcloud is a French company that specializes in providing virtualized resources to businesses.
- The company wants to achieve "zero emissions" by 2030.
- To do this, OVHcloud will focus its efforts on five key areas: infrastructure (servers for short-term goals of being carbon neutral and storing renewable energy), applications, metering/ billing, data center efficiency, and customer experience. OVHcloud is a 15-year old French company that specializes in environmental impact analysis of businesses.
-Their process for industrializing the cloud, designing infrastructure, and fully integrating renewable energy sources has led to the best possible response to climate change, while also promoting circular economy needs among their customers.
-The overall energy consumption of data centers has stabilized due to improvements made in servers and cloud usage. This is mainly due to the increasing use of cloud services which can share and absorb the impact from old buildings that are being re-adapted into data centers. 
-Optimization of infrastructure is an essential but only partial solution; it cannot solve all aspects of data center energy consumption. OVHcloud does not use air conditioning to maintain the problem. Beyond this work, it is then necessary cooling of its servers. Since 2003, it has been replaced by evaluating the entire chain of impact and looking at them systemically through water cooling (watercooling): upper layers, applications, analyze the writing code water is directly injected into the processor to cool it and determine their impact on energy consumption. reducing drastically. In this spirit, OVHcloud has initiated a partnership with Inria o Le PUE (energy efficiency indicator) centers of (Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du données) : 
-OVHcloud is included between 1.09 and 1.3 (average for digital) in order to inform its customers on the impact of their own industry being 2 points).
-OVHcloud also reaches an index outside of cloud usage services, and optimize their uses . Pair 0.2 for its efficiency in using water (average for industry being 1.8L/kWh). 
-Ecological circularity: 
-Two dedicated ranges for our servers for a second and third life. 
-100% of our components are integrated in this process (tripling, reutilization and recycling). The document discusses the negative aspects of data centers, and how they are not balanced energetically.
-The digital world: an illusion? The limits of PUE 
-As was mentioned earlier, the digital world, which we take for granted, is actually virtual.
-Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) does not accurately reflect the true materiality of the computer. 
-Relying on artificial means to create a semblance of reality instead is fatal for information technology.
-A data center with a very low PUE can continue to do nothing about the energy generated by the hardware in its computers. 
-Qarnot's distributed approach allows for this by distributing the power use across many sources. The principle of the Joule effect is universal.
- A computer distribution platform, the Q.Ware, was developed to reduce environmental costs associated with construction, energy wasted for cooling, and users of heating or air conditioning systems. 
- Beyond a loss in thermal energy emitted by computers: the obvious environmental equation, this edge computing energy-efficient data centers are not balanced... have major environmental advantages, as well as security guarantees offered by Qarnot. 
- Qarnot values thermal death in smart buildings, smart cities: where's the brain? By distributing computing power directly where heat is necessary. 
- Most of the time today, these data centers send microprocessors too often into centralized data centers which then release city frequency and generate heat waves. The document discusses the issue of climate change and how it affects security.
-Qarnot's approach is to reduce carbon emissions by 89% when the city or building is not involved in the process (-89%).
-The approach of Qarnot, with its focus on digital technology, is seen as a solution that can distribute computing power directly into buildings. 
-The "digital" term encompasses a wide range of realities and sectors. Some techno-optimists like the World Economic Forum believe that it will lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 15%. Le modèle économique est fondamental pour les secteurs qui profitent de l’efficacité et de l’optimisation permises par les modèles climatiques.
- Les chiffres reposent sur de nombreuses hypothèses, dont celle du numérique commercial des données impulsées techniques et économiques discutables.
- Un travail d’analyse basé sur trois fonctionnements est nécessaire : maximiser le potentiel serait nécessaire pour confronter ces projections à la réalité, capturer les données, vendre et comprendre comment trier le bon grain de l’ivraie dans ces espaces publicitaires et/ou d’équipements.
- La formation des professionnels du secteur (designers, ingénieurs, etc.) est primordiale pour que le « numérique » soit un standard pour toutes les commandes publiques et de collectivités. De façon opératoire, il doit opérer sa transformation afin de se conformer aux exigences The digital environment and responding effectively to Paris agreements among others. The digital sector is expressed (while re-examining them). It responds to six complex issues, which can constitute a sector on its own and are principles: transverse to most other sectors. 
-To promote the life of electronic equipment 
-To reduce global consumption of electronic waste 
-To increase the life of services as such energy, emissions of greenhouse gases, and 
-To optimize for difficult usage conditions 
-Being a key entry point for integrating other good practices from the web (accessibility, security, governance, open data) 
There is a lack of data needed in order to make informed decisions quickly: manufacturers lack data on their ecosystems and this limits the precision of analyses cycle accuracy. The document discusses the role of digital infrastructure and services in a world of life.
-The ACV (actual, committed and potential) data of car manufacturers is stabilizing at 2°C? Here is the political roadmap that needs to structure our fundamental thinking about the impacts of digital choices, it must be explored and determined using environmental data from the sector. These are important better data, more research and better training for practitioners. 
-The sector is strongly externalized, so it's necessary to include partners/suppliers in our deliberations. 
-Digital technology has allowed for the creation of new services, which have accelerated past trends, allowed more people to enjoy new opportunities and has become an essential factor in progress. 
-Then he surpassed us. We followed his lead by working collaboratively with the state to pursue an effusive race to innovation: Digital has become a defining factor in designing new digital jobs The document discusses the need to adapt service and experience-based industries before becoming equipment, it is necessary. We must modify the very DNA of the subject while it was only an instrument.
-According to the defender of rights, by 2020, digital inclusion will be (GreenIT.fr) and social (inclusion and accessibility) in educational courses become the first factor of exclusion. 
-Schools: "Sustainable by design"
-After this observation, what should be done? The digital future of businesses can only be sustainable if it serves a responsible strategy. 
-Our major companies have a primary responsibility to shift the debate, include considerations about environmental (and social) impacts in their plans, and build a better future. 
-We must continue to imagine strategies for business using environmental (and social) considerations as key factors, aware, ethical, and persistent in our imagination. 
-It is not enough to work on solutions for tomorrow; we need citizens to regain confidence that we can face tomorrow's challenges. We - Businesses – need to work on restoring trust first by demonstrating that ultimately science and consciousness can work together And be exemplary. Revisiting the entire life cycle of a product or service before making a decision is essential. We should rationalize based on best practices such as digital workplace, cloud migration, company network, waste management... optimizing our digital footprint and meeting just needs The standish group – Chaos report 2009 stated that "25% of the transport sector will be digital by 2017." 
- TeleCoop believes that the economic model of telecom providers, where customers are offered unlimited plans with no restrictions on data usage, is not responsible for environmental concerns. They propose that legislation be put in place to punish those providers who do this. 
- When Gartner speaks about 25% of the transport sector being digital by 2017, our ratio is two times higher. TELECOOP wants to take a contrarian stance and challenge the telecom providers' economic model. They believe that it is time for legislators to sanction those providers who offer unlimited plans with no restrictions on data usage to their customers and do not encourage their clients to manage their data responsibly. TeleCoop is a French telecommunications company.
-500 employees, who do not have an eco-designed website based on a reference such as those for people with disabilities (RGAA), the priority is transparency. 
-First, semantics: the terms "sustainable" or "responsible" for online video platforms that do not adapt to users' screens size are not normative; each person has their own definition. 
-Second, resolution of their content to the size of a mobile phone's screen: TeleCoop's shareholders and customers of TeleCoop expect that terms "sustainable" or "responsible" be systematically the builders whose phones cannot connect to associated WiFi networks instead of climate change and its set goals for reducing telephone emissions by 50% by 2030. 
-Regarding 5G, TeleCoop was surprised by Madame Secretary of State Agnès Pannier-Runacher's declaration in June 30th that France will stop using 5G because it is harmful to humans and the environment. 
-TeleCoop estimates this share at 50%, 25% through prepaid contracts with an engagement clause. We suggest amending Arcep's attributions so it can manage frequencies more efficiently. The French law to ensure that no government can rely on this fact makes citizens better informed, for example, the Authority for Telecommunications Regulation (Arcep) for any project such as 5G deployment, on the interest of telecom operators to deploy rapidly developing electronic communications as quickly as possible. We could deduce from this that telecom operators will increase their ecological footprint at national scale, and this in terms of sales revenues. There is no prior impact study required.
-Why we ask for public advertising of these data on the Arcep's website TeleCoop, its shareholders and customers are glad that Arcep has opened a new chapter in its history by engaging telecommunications sector. 
-These data are even more crucial given that Arcep established the telecommunications sector heading towards a sustainable digital future. We ask you to believe that we will be with you and vigilant in guarding environmental issues caused by digital devices. It is essential that French digital culture reflect excellence both environmentally and economically.
-China's third path guided by environmental excellence is emerging. Companies rewarding customer loyalty offer subsidies for a new terminal (without an engagement commitment) incent clients to renew their terminal via an offer with a commitment below three years old. The Shift Project applauds ARCEP for joining the digital sustainability debate. 
-We feel that the last 6 months have been focused on measures that need to be taken beyond sharing observations, in order to get public authorities to take action on necessary measures: 
-It is urgent for policymakers to promote measures encouraging people to keep their devices as long as possible, in order to avoid physical and software obsolescence. 
-We need a more environmental rationality in transitioning to digital technologies, taking into account different technologies' energy efficiency when providing services, for example. The Nouveau projet proposes to penalize wasteful use of video 4K on part of energy "gray" that it will produce both in advance of mobile in the subway) its exploitation as well as at the end of its life, as well as all quantifiable emissions including on scope 3. It is necessary to ban unlimited prepaid offers by operators. The sense of abundance we are plunged into by these offers is an illusion we need to fight. The role of ARCEP regulator today is limited to telecom networks 

It is essential to discourage abusive practices by telecommunications platforms. They represent only a part resting on techniques of marketing attention, practices energy consumption for digital media. However, leading to uncontrolled inflation in digital volumes the effect lever they have vis-à-vis terminals and appliances, and inducing also a loss of free-market discretion altogether, gives choices applied there a responsibility opposed to the original objectives of Internet industrial but more so political on the future of our society. Deploying technology without regulating user's uses that rebound effect will multiply indefinitely unacceptably not only are modes of living compatible with carbon constraint, it is necessary both prioritize electronic uses "positive climate return" and limit environmental impact direct from digital media, thus making a real break from habits providers and consumers have taken since one The document is about the 78TIBCO campaign "Bien vivre le numérique. Garantir un monde numérique durable en prenant soin de l’économie, de l’humain et de la planète."
-Tibco's ambition is to become the first eco-friendly digital services provider.
-Part of Tibco's commitment to sustainability is working with ARCEP on a platform for sustainable digital usage.
-Some of Tibco's actions in this regard include transitioning its fleet to electric vehicles and implementing waste management practices that are environmentally friendly both for users and network operators.
-In addition, Tibco has entered into energy contracts that are designated as "green" based on their specific industrial and technological expertise. The goal of the company is to be sustainable. 
-We are aware that we need eco-recycled materials and we want to experiment with incorporating sustainability into our economic model, accounting for triple capital... We have integrated environmental responsibility as a strategic development pillar in our 2020 -2023 transformation plan, which takes full sense when looking at our 2020 -2023 sustainability vision. 
-A systemic and partnership-based approach is being piloted and in which many ecological initiatives have been identified. We believe it is important to keep a systemic view in order to bring the best possible ecological solutions: 
-Analysis of life cycle, usage, environmental effects. Tibco's strategy is: Living digital well. Ensuring a world with digital sustainability by taking care of economy, people and planet. 
-We have 3 key issues to address: Sustainable world of the internet, taking care of people and planet while staying competitive on environmental measures (CO2 emissions total, amount of minerals mined, ROI). 
-The economy: Don't forget that society's goal is to be collective and profitable working together with all actors for the common good. Let's do this by innovating technologically while being the most competitive yet respecting environment. These transformations will take time. We don't have pretensions that we can change the world alone; we are humble enough to work together with recycled materials. New offers arrive with us committing ourselves to participate wholeheartedly. You can count on our evolution Tibco is a company that employs many people. 
- They are called Tibs and they are always looking out for the well-being of their employees. 
- The transformation will happen with each one of us and we believe it is important to preserve human capital. 
- We want to use solutions that have a positive environmental impact, especially when it comes to reducing carbon footprints. 
- We also want our customers to be able to move around easily, use less energy, recycle, and repair things. 
- In order for us to make this happen, we need some kind of regulation on the downstream side as well as upstream. The document discusses how the French government is trying to reduce the amount of data consumers are using. 
-One example of this is a recent bill that would make it harder for consumers to use data on websites and apps. 
-This could have a negative impact on consumers because it would be harder to control how many text messages or phone calls they send or make. 
-Moreover, limiting mobile data could redefine the current market landscape by segmenting offers more sharply and potentially depriving less affluent consumers of one of the most important tools for using the internet on their phones. The National Digital Council, which through the integration of data used online fixes in the field of regulation of data quantity. Such an approach could be particularly problematic, breaking with a framework that has today fully integrated consumer daily lives and allowed the emergence of new services, namely abundance in terms of usable data via fixed networks.

-"We support the Commission's ambitions to build a resilient, green and digital Europe." We are optimistic about the potential benefits that technology and connectivity can have on our planet as they improve efficiency in services with high energy intensity such as public transportation systems, public roads and our company's motto is "Connecting for a better future." For example, in the city of Guadalajara we are optimistic about how technology and connectivity can change the future for the better by reducing energy consumption in city infrastructure such as streetlights from 68% to 13500 using IoT technologies integrated into vehicles. 
Major challenges facing our sector include energy consumption management; emissions of carbon; waste production from vehicles; and "Nous adoptons une approche globale fixant de carburant allant jusqu’à 30% et une économie estimée à des objectifs ambitieux sur tous nos marchés, par exemple nos 4,8 millions de tonnes de CO2e."

- "Nous nous engageons à réduire notre empreinte carbone grâce à une efficacité énergétique améliorée, à l’approvisionnement en énergie renouvelable, à la réduction de nos déchets de réseau et à de nouveaux critères environnementaux lorsque nous sélectionnons nos fournisseurs." Vodafone is a telecommunications company with operations in Europe and Africa. 
-The company has 12 million connections to intelligent energy meters using its IoT technology, saving 1.6 million tons of CO2. 
-Vodafone is one of the largest providers of wireless networks in Europe and Africa. 
-The company has committed to developing plans for reducing its carbon footprint. 
-Wifirst believes that recommendations for developing plans to minimize the carbon footprint of networks should take into account available protocols on terminals. 
-Quantifying the impact of data flows across all infrastructure operated by Wifirst is important in order to consider how best to minimize network carbon footprints. The available protocols on terminals: (fabrication, transport upstream, downstream, installation, operation (ie energy consumption), disposal, recycling) 
In general, "1GB transmitted over fiber consumes less energy than 1GB transmitted over an electric conductor" and "1GB to be evaluated the impact of the frequency of wireless renewal transmission WiFi consumes less than 1GB transmitted in cellular phone." 
Equipment on carbon footprint of networks However, a device that is not equipped to be connected to identify the levers of reduction of carbon footprint by fiber or Ethernet filaire will have only two options: cell phone activity operator telecommunications and WiFi. Connecting it in wire would add equipment connections, which would increase the carbon cost This project, currently underway, and conducted in partnership with leading external consultants first class , must result in by 2021 at the latest. expensive in terms of carbon emissions than a mobile phone but it will consume much more energy than a cell phone. Another formulation: one hour of video-conference on an wired computer is likely more polluting than on an electronic device If our networks' intelligence should allow mobile consumption based on electricity consumption very different from controlled energy consumption , implementation of digital always these two terminals. more responsible must also pass through user awareness about their impacts. This goes along with a global consciousness with perhaps recognition value for reducing environmental impacts Wifirst is a telecom B2B specializing in WiFi « as a service ». We deploy and operate WiFi networks for a variety of businesses: the big retail chains, hotels, student residences, and even the military. Our goal is to allow professionals to improve their productivity through connectivity and save money with durable WiFi networks. That’s why we put climate action at the heart of our strategy – we deploy sustainable networks with our clients. 
- The principle already exists in the electric industry with regards to network construction. [To act] 3
- To create a sustainable digital world, Arcep has outlined concrete actions for building an environmentally friendly internet. Among these are proposals from standardization to taxation. 
- With its regulatory background, Arcep wanted to explore mechanisms that could incentivize economic agents—providers and users—to reduce environmental impact around three pillars. 
- Part one of this report focuses on data analysis revealing the need for more detailed environmental impact measurements for all components of the digital ecosystem, moving beyond awareness and taking appropriate measures accordingly. This need was also expressed during most workshops and roundtables . The authority has organized recent meetings. It highlights the need to give public authorities powers to collect information from digital actors in order to monitor their footprint and measure the effect of their practices (3.1).
-Furthermore, during these discussion moments, various effects of leverage or proposals for action were identified directly on online networks, giving the Arcep an opportunity to list actions in order to incorporate the environmental issue into its regulatory activities (3.2).
-The discussions also highlighted the importance of a strengthening of incentives for economic actors and users, with particular emphasis on deploying an ecoconsciousness across all actors in the digital sector (3.3).
-Before detailing these different proposals, the Arcep wants to present a first analysis (that actors can propose amendments to) positioning different digital actors and describing their effects on infrastructure in relation to environmental questions, based on this description.
-Later on, additional transversal issues might be added to this analysis over time, such as the link between cyber risk and environmental risk which was addressed in part at an event co-organized by ANSSI and Arcep and summarized in 2.1.9. The document discusses the various factors that influence energy consumption.
- Usage by users also plays a role, as in the design of services and applications.
- Two dimensions are taken into account: how services are designed (encoding, optimization…) by content and application providers, and users' consumption (volume, type of services used).
- Other actors influencing networks include operators of terminals (86% of emissions related to hearing come from "communications equipment producers"), or equipment manufacturers themselves (when producing subscription or rental services for example).
- Characteristics such as high pricing and an automatic billing system can lead to increased demand for less environmentally friendly devices. 
- Distribution channels (new, volume consumed) can also have an impact on network sustainability. l’abonné qui y a souscrit. de ces terminaux (voir atelier 1), peut être effectuée de manière physique ou en ligne.

- Also due to their frequent replacement because of premature hardware retirement. For example, OS stopping maintenance or application no longer compatible with current devices leading users to upgrade their equipment in order to access latest services and features available.

Content delivery networks or networks for distributing content are platforms used by content providers and application developers to connect their content with the final customer and improve user experience while having a global connectivity and reducing transmission costs. Reducing distance between customers and servers allows overall latency reduction and increase La régulation est une approche qui consiste à améliorer la gestion des risques environnementaux liés aux choix et aux activités des utilisateurs dans l’univers numérique.
- La collecte de données permet notamment de piloter les aspects appelés « régulation par la donnée » environnementaux.
- Dans ce cadre, il convient de définir les données pertinentes à collecter. « un choc de transparence »: The transparency shock indicates a lack of effective governance.
- Indicators of management (3.1.3): To reduce information asymmetries, information collection must be equal and multiply the impact of action taken by the regulator.
- Information available to the public should be made more accessible and used to inform users and the general public about their choices in consumption.
- Actors should use these tools to discuss and add value to them, slowly (3.3.5).
- « Plateformisation » of public action: By providing better information on the issues at stake, regulation can help mobilize citizens' power effectively. In 2019, four independent regulatory agencies -the Autorité de la concurrence, l’Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), l’Arcep, and CNIL - released a report on civil society group's work 143 entitled "A Better Regulation for All: A Framework for Action". This report calls for increased citizen engagement with government institutions as well as better data collection and analysis by regulators in order to make informed decisions. 
- In 2018, a working group was created within an informal civil society group called "Groupe d'action civile pour une meilleure régulation" consisting of representatives from various independent regulatory agencies including the Autorité de la concurrence, l’Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), l’Arcep, and CNIL; this group meets twice per year to discuss topics across sectors. Pilot the work and reflections in common. This group is now composed of eight institutions.

- In order to formalize their thoughts and make progress on regulation that the Arcep has gone further and extended data-driven regulation. These discussions have allowed for the agency to identify two main objectives - amplifying its ability to act beyond strengthening its human resources and illuminating regulatory choices or financial considerations - as well as introducing user base understanding tools. The collective note highlights legal grounds allowing for the regulator to also consider the environmental impact of digital uses and inform users about their responsibilities in this field.

3.1.3 Identify indicators measuring environmental impact. Implementation for a sustainable system requires collecting data across all aspects of ecosystem management. Data could be collected on an ecosystem level affecting transnational communication shock on environmental footprint 
The Arcep presents in this part a overview of its work on data-driven regulation with other important topics such as developing user understanding tools and expanding the scope of data available for analysis by using crowd sourcing methods . Environmental data collection would benefit from identifying indicators measuring impacts across all areas of ecosystem management including technology usage . The document is a preliminary environmental indicators list that some types of actors or services. These could be useful in collecting. This information will be essential to the proposal based, in part, on water and construction project plans already conducted or in progress, and also on the sector’s ability to use digital technologies. 
-The current understanding of the Arcep’s regulatory powers, as defined broadly, requires data collection from all interested parties with a mandate to specify the format of this data collection. 
-The following proposals are listed below as a first proposal on which actors are invited to respond. The Arcep is prepared to undertake this exercise on other topics where it has already offered its participation. In practice, the Arcep has already committed itself in this direction within the limits of its current competences. 
-Collecting all these proposals would be a complex and challenging task for anyone involved, let alone an institution like the Arcep with limited resources today. As such, deploying such an initiative would require careful planning The document discusses the need for a progressive approach to electronic data collection, with indicators including additional studies on emissions from construction work between actors.
-It is suggested that emission data be collected from key operators necessary to achieve an ever more relevant and disaggregated electronic communications data set.
-The ISO 14064-18 standard of 2006 specifies principles and requirements for quantifying and drafting reports on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and their elimination. 
-The standard includes requirements for design, development, management, reporting, verification of inventory, among others. Scope 1: Directives on climate change 
- Scope 2: Emissions associated with energy 
- Scope 3: Indirect emissions Indicateurs, carbon dioxide) of different actors in the telecommunications sector who can appear very close to each other, are complementary. 
- While reducing emissions from gas-emitting technologies is an objective of Paris Agreement agreements, a list of priority indicators for climate action is proposed below by type of technology. 
- A synthesis of the indicators that are considered most important is presented at the end of this part.
- It is essential to obtain aggregate data on sectoral difficulties in accounting for them. aux doubles comptes, par exemple dans les cas de prestation de service entre opérateurs de communications électroniques;
- ISO 14064-1 est la norme internationale pour définir les scopes des émissions GES;
- la consommation en kWh permet d’analyser la consommation énergétique de l’acteur sans considération de son empreinte carbone;
- les stratégies de décarbonation incluent notamment la capture des émissions de GES;
- le but du collecteur est notamment d’obtenir une représentation complète et objective des impacts environnementaux des acteurs sur les réseaux La loi AGEC prévoit déjà que les fabricants d’équipements et de terminaux n’émetteurs communiquent pas seulement des données sur les modèles d’affaires utilisés, mais aussi sur le cycle de vie des équipements distribués.
- Ceci permettrait une compréhension par les équipementiers plus fine et ainsi une analyse correctement identifier les sources plus pertinentes des effets de levier et des d'émission lors de ces processus de actions à entreprendre. 
- Par ailleurs, en complément des indices de réparabilité et de durabilité, un indice de recyclabilité pourrait également être envisagé. The document discusses the need for more accurate environmental indicators, such as consumption of limited resources (biotic, rare earths, etc.), in order to have a reliable and useful vision without becoming too complex to collect.
- This system should be secure enough not to interfere with business secrets of the operators and protect consumer privacy and freedom.
- There are currently insufficient policy measures to face the increase in digital usage. For example: availability of documentation, ease of system assembly and disassembly, necessary tools and equipment available and available for long term use, ratio between price of product and price of parts. (which may encourage product obsolescence), the time it takes between repair start and next malfunction, frequency and results of quality tests and wear tests, estimated life span of key composite materials (minimum robustness and estimated duration of material lifespan).

-It may be useful, in a second time, to clarify this collection at a higher level (describing it as scope and by service digital) or even encouragements (FCA developing services personalized for consumers on environmental consumption levels).
-Most of the consumed content on the internet is directly related to these digital consumption levels. This within the same mindset as the obligation imposed on telecommunications operators.
-A reduced number of FCA concentrate in terms of law AGEC. The majority of users are served by systems operating systems (OSs), which assemble most often a large number of users and have a significant role because they define access conditions and some data usage conditions for using services offered. Services qui peuvent avoir un impact environnemental indirect, liés au fonctionnement du service et à la demande de l’utilisateur (par exemple le volume de données mobilisées pour les publicités vidéo, etc.)
- La collecte de cookies permettrait d'identifier les pratiques des utilisateurs et fournirait ainsi des informations utiles sur l'environnement des services The indirects defined here have a sole purpose of illustrating the proposi- tions made in this report and do not have a recognized definition beyond this. There is no known authority covering the effects described here. What are the implications of commercial models for service providers, terminal operators, and distributors? Editors of service, operating systems, distributors of terminals, and users... What role each party plays in defining marketing practices? What are the impacts of purchase, rental, or sharing models for terminals? What advertising and incentives could support an energy conservation effort for devices and content?

-First, with regard to device suppliers concerning firstly energy consumption by equipment, it might be pertinent to collect information on installed OS levels supported by ITEE (IT equipment efficiency) which measures service on these different OS as well as effective energy consumption over their updates. Such indicators would allow us to better understand real-world hardware obsolescence. In a second division based on nominal electricity consumption time period, it might be useful to have data on available hardware capacity. ITEU (IT equipment utilization) is another indicator measuring efficiency both in terms of physical and virtual resources.

-It would be valuable to track device cycle life using metrics such as ITEE (IT equipment efficiency) or ITEU (IT equipment utilization). This would help us measure actual resource utilization éner- gétique des équipements informatiques: The ecological impact of information technology equipment.
- Collecting data from managers or operators of energy centres of other installations (such as a climate control system, ventilation, and distribution system) might also be useful in order to get an overview of the environmental impact.
- PUE (Power usage effectiveness): 14% of the environmental impact of digital devices in France can be measured through center of data collection. Many studies have been conducted on individual users’ ability to evaluate the multi-criteria impacts according to their life cycle156. In a second step, data such as carbon dioxide emissions and consumption kWh could be collected in order to follow the evolution of center data centers.
- WUE (Water usage effectiveness): It would make sense at first to collect information on direct and indirect emissions and water use in kWh for each installation158. In a second step, information on the amount of CO2 emitted and water used indirectly and wasted could be collected. The study aims to understand the current state of data center recycling and repair, and to develop metrics for assessing their performance.
- The study will collect data on materials used in data centers, as well as secondary materials that can be useful for analyzing their lifecycle and improving efficiency.
- These findings will help improve data center design and operation. The document discusses ways to green computing and electronic communications services and networks so that they are climate neutral by 2050.
- La consommation énergétique d’un centre est 159 kWh/an. Selon la définition retenue par la Programmation pluriannuelle de l’énergie, « chaleur générée par un procédé qui n’en constitue pas la finalité première, et qui n’est pas récupérée ». De données se répartit entre ses équipements (serveur, stock), ses autres installations (réseau) et ses utilisateurs.
- D’après cette étude, 30 % des serveurs physiques seraient « comateux ». Si la virtualisation semblait permettre une meilleure optimisation de l’usage de ces serveurs, une étude de 2017 sur un panel distribution d’énergie confirme que 10 % des serveurs virtualisés sont « comateux ». Indicates on networks, guests to respond to them. Collecting from operators 
-In addition, some proposed indicators may be considered as priority emissions of GHG and others, collected at a later date.
-In a first time: by scope in a second time.
-In a second time: by segment of networks (heart, collection, access) and by technology for access known to the ARCEP. Some (2G, 3G, 4G, ADSL, Fibre, Cable etc.) of the indicators mentioned below are already available or research is ongoing in this area. It will be useful to determine which network maturity levels these works have and the ability to make public data produced. 
-The electricity consumption of boxes in homes in one year will be important to measure also taking into account other environmental factors such as carbon dioxide emissions from terminals 
-Indicators for terminals should be collected from major terminal manufacturers In a first step, the number of terminals sold by category (new/reconditioned and subsidized/unused) 
- In a first step, the volume of collected/recycled - The volume of terminals collected by actors whose terminals are actually re-conditioned, recycled and not treated (thrown away) - The volume of recycled material Indicators that allow for the construction of indices on durability and repairability are mandatory under the law AGEC from 2021 and 2024 
Other environmental impacts 
In a first step, the total data stored and transmitted 
In a second step, the total data processed - Including main data and unneeded data (cookies, pubic ads etc.) Practices of FCA: 
In a first step: number of OS supported by digital service 
In a second step: number of updates offered (including evolutionary updates and corrective updates) by digital service Practices of OS publishers: 
In a first step: duration of maintenances for major OS in circulation by actor 
In a second step: number of updates offered (including evolutionary updates and corrective updates) by actor • In an additional step, an analysis on cycle life for each service The document discusses emissions from data centers and the electricity consumption. 
- In the global context, emissions are divided into two categories: by scope and by service digital. 
- Electricity consumption is measured in terms of kilowatt hours (KWh). 
- In France, electricity consumption is measured by different actors according to their scope of activity. For example, ITEE measures it for France as a whole, while PUE measures it for French operators. 
- The first measure compares energy consumption in France with that of other countries while the second measure compares energy consumption within France among different actors. 
- Other environmental impacts are also discussed including water usage effectiveness and the use of thermal energy produced by data centers. The document discusses ways to improve energy efficiency, with a focus on wireless networks.
-One issue is that there is no consensus on how to measure energy efficiency. This makes comparisons between technologies difficult.
-Transitioning to a digital and environmentally friendly society will require more than just technological change; it will also require changes in policy. The document mentions that fine, careful approaches need to take into account the dependence or non-dependence of performance on traffic volume.
- As mentioned in 1.1.2, performance or even mastery of energy management is often a matter of contention between different technologies, with older technologies considered more efficient than newer ones that are "in silo" and disregard the energy consumption of individual technologies and users' specific needs.
- This is why the Arcep has observed an acceleration in fiber deployments coupled with an increase in subscribers on fiber networks, reinforcing its view that there is now a global movement towards fiber infrastructure and supporting its goal of developing new means to integrate connectivity and efficiency.
- It is therefore important to supplement these unitary evaluations with an approach that takes into account the unique characteristics and competing capabilities of different technologies as well as consumer behavior patterns. The two fixed networks in France are not 3.2.2 encouraging a viable economic transition, and would also represent an overconsumption of fixed-line broadband towards fibre both in terms of energy and resources. 
-In its new regulatory cycle (2021-2023), and in accordance with its national and European objectives of regulation, the French Autorité de régulation des communications électroniques (ARCEP) intends to promote and encourage a transition from copper coverage to fibre throughout the country, owned by Orange 164, which has operated this network for over 50 years. 
-The ARCEP believes that the project undertaken by Orange, which it is pleased with and holds in high regard, represents an improved mental impact relative to the copper network (ADSL or RTC) as regards broadband services (TV and telephone services). 
-Ten years ago, operators decided to deploy competing networks of fibre until users were able to switch to fibre optic cable at their homes (FTTH – Fiber To The Home). It is inevitable that this phase of transition between copper and fibre will involve coexistence of two networks for a while. The ARCEP estimates that the project undertaken by Orange—which it applauds—will have a positive mental impact on society overall compared to the copper network (ADSL or RTC). The principle of the de la son principe, remains largely to energy consumption of the infrastructural qualifier for responding to unknowns in terms of. Fiber consumption is thus a such a project raises. It is important to estimated as three to four times less ensure, in order to avoid that this situation that for copper line163 This benefit does not last, only Orange can enter into a contract with respect to the network only part of it, as he has himself defined calendar, and could be diluted by energy-consumption electrical equipment connected at its terminals (Internet box) connected to the copper wire from 2023 and ending in 2030. fiber. This can be sup- erior to that of equipment connected to copper wires164, due for example to a greater number of features onboard or higher data and communication speeds. The transition towards fiber should eventually allow for an environmental imprint that is several times lower than what would be achieved with traditional telephony services. Special vigilance must be maintained in order to maintain this advantage over copper wiring. 164. Telephone switched circuit (TCC) is the historical technology used for fixed telephone service (a phone plugged directly into "T"). Orange has decided not to sell or operate this technology because of its obsolescence. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain each year because providers no longer produce fixed telephone networks while requiring either one or no longer producing the necessary equipment needed for network operation S. et al. is a report that was cited in the France Stratégie, “Maîtriser la consommation énergétique du numérique : le progrès technologique n’y suffira pas,” October 2014. 
- The document discusses electricity consumption of communication networks and how it has not been keeping up with technological progress. 
- Some initiatives or issues were discussed that relate to network optimization and how to take advantage of existing infrastructure when possible. This approach allows for administrative deployments to be more efficient both economically and environmentally since it limits the amount of new construction needed. The Arcep proposes to manage consumables duplication between opera- and packaging operations, which do not need to build complete network connections for operators and subcontractors. 
- The goal is to reduce waste generation and ensure proper regulation of the Arcep. 
- Regarding copper and fiber networks, the Arcep plans to address these practices with operators, especially in terms of cumulative kilometers. 
- Finally, the Arcep also proposes to approach these practices with operators, in line with their very great majority belonging to Orange and expressing concerns at several workshops on network deployment in copper. The key characteristic of this sustainable infrastructure is its essential but non-reproducible nature. The question of how best to manage it needs further study. The document discusses the Arcep's efforts to regulate access to infrastructure for use by operators of fiber optic networks. 
-The document mentions that in 2008, the Arcep created mechanisms to automatically suspend access to boxes used by engineers in the civil engineering department at Orange. 
-Operators are obligated to use infrastructure during certain hours or when access is mandated by Orange, which allows for efficient use of extended hours. 
-Wireless networks with a reach of 560,000 kilometers and more than 13 million poles already installed will avoid duplicating an infrastructure with a large footprint. For new deployments, the Arcep intends to be attentive to developing innovative technologies, such as micro trenches under roads, which could limit environmental impact during network deployment construction. The following is a list of bullet points about the document.
- Several dozens of millions of terminals do not function today only in 2G and 3G networks. 
- The growth of consumption on 2G and 3G mobile data, as well as an increase in network capacity requirements for 2G or 3G networks would lead to the significant burden on existing 2G or 3G networks. 
- Extinction at short notice of demand for high-speed mobile services with current technologies (2G and/or 3G) would require a very large investment on 4G and 5G networks which are still in development. 
- However, these new technologies are more energy efficient, both from a technical standpoint and from an environmental standpoint. 
- While it is still difficult to quantify the full impact, it seems that they will allow consumers to consume less energy for the same amount of traffic. The document discusses the issue of band switching between participants in an at-ease network. 
- One band out of six is currently used to connect 3G networks. 
- These technologies use few resources compared to extinction, and continue to decrease usage of certain applications. 
- Two other ideas need to be considered: first, the residual traffic on 2G and 3G networks should still be significant. 
- And secondly, as foreign examples show, a significant amount of calls on older generations' networks are redirected to more recent technologies in order for them to serve better inside and outside buildings (on average, 80% of minutes on 2G or 3G networks are still transmitted via old technology in 2019). In any case, many old 2G and 3G networks will eventually disappear. The document discusses the impact of technology extinction on network operators and consumers.
- There is a complex environmental impact to consider when considering technology extinction, as it affects network operators' operational decisions (for example, during emergency calls).
- The operator should be encouraged to deploy and configure their networks in a way that takes these impacts into account. Les réseaux mobiles ont une grande influence sur l’environnement.
-L’Arcep propose d’étudier en 2021 la dimension environnementale dans les enquêtes de qualité de service des réseaux mobiles.
-Cette étude permettrait aux utilisateurs de choisir leurs réseaux également en fonction des efforts environnementaux des opérateurs. The document discusses the reduction of environmental impact.
-It proposes to examine in priority questions of mutualization and service quality today mainly concerning coverage and quality of service provided by operators.
-Barometers measuring reduction of environmental impact are published yearly by various actors.
-The increased mutualization of networks (at different levels in networks operated by operators) could be a lever for reducing environmental impact.
-Physical levers mentioned include: Vorising the competition between operators, structural changes such as edge computing or cloud RAN170, which will pose new questions about the opportunity for users to choose between an architecture based on centralized control or one that allows more flexibility in future development with regard to use cases such as web, streaming, and voice. Edge computing is a distributed or centralized network deployment where resources for calculation and data storage are increasingly being deployed in small cells near users.
- One way to improve the environmental impact of networks is to allocate frequencies equally among network nodes, which can be more beneficial than allocation of frequencies based on node size.
- Automation, optimization, and auto-configuration of networks based on machine learning and artificial intelligence are also growing areas of interest.
- Virtualization, logicialization of networks, and eventually “cloudification” of them are potential future extensions. Novant servir de leviers de réduction de vateurs necessitent un approfondissement du l’empreinte environnementale. 
- Pour quantifier leurs capacités échéant, l’Autorité pourra utiliser les outils à disposition comme les régulations dont elle dispose déjà. 
- Dès lors qu’ils sont intrinsèquement liés au déploiement des réseaux, les solutions relatives aux leviers logiques apparaissent tôt et peuvent être utiles à préciser. Cloud-RAN ou C-RAN (Cloud Radio Access Network) is a centralized network architecture based on virtualization and cloud technologies, which allows an efficient deployment at large scale and collaborative use of radio technologies and their virtualization. 
- Several initiatives are currently underway in order to standardize this technology. See glossary.
- Regarding the environmental impacts of digital economies, the OECD has published a report in November 2020 entitled « The digital economy outlook » in which it recognizes that the internet presents both opportunities and challenges for sustainable development. For example, while acknowledging the benefits of digital technologies for growth (in terms of green urban development), they may also not open up regular conflict zones. This issue exists also with regard to energy consumption or electronic waste proliferation. 
- Studies in this area might be undertaken as part of upcoming programs in engineering The document is about the work of account. 
-The Arcep proposes to address these issues with OECD, in particular within their working groups on infrastructure policies and telecommunications operators. 
-More specifically, when it comes to UN initiatives concerning digital governance, and international environmental challenges, one can note that the last forum on internet governance (IGF-2020) saw for the first time the theme of environment as a topic in its main panel alongside other topics such as data or inclusion. 
-Due to the diversity of actors involved in digital transformation at different levels, it is essential for policymaking at all levels to take into account environmental implications transnationally. European Union law rests historically on a normativ The document discusses the need to take into account the environmental impact of digital technologies when developing policies and strategies.
-The European Union has initiated a number of studies aimed at strengthening the existing framework for information and communication technology (ICT) with, among others, expanding application design direction to produce recommendations on improving sustainability and repairability of equipment across all sectors and common waste management systems for measuring the environmental impact or even improving collection efficiency in public markets for ecological goods.
-New environmental standards are also being drafted for public markets based on eco-design principles. The moment of writing this report and November 25, 2020, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging the Commission to take measures to improve value chain circularity. The resolution contains three proposals for strategy: fighting obsolescence and improving user information towards sustainable production and consumption modes, a strategy for repair, deployment of a global strategy towards an economy of reuse and recycling. Special attention is given to goods with a digital dimension with emphasis on responsibility of software (point 7 of the resolution). The necessary criteria for constituting a true digital market are thus in favor of harmonized approaches. Current specific environmental considerations related to electronic communications establish the European Union's regulatory authority (BEREC) as an important dialogue and coordination platform to ensure the development of good practices adapted to reality in the sector and implementation at EU level up to its environmental ambitions. The Commission has already indicated that it will review the need for strengthening transparency of environmental data in the telecommunications sector in order to allow final users better direction of their choice of consumption 177 box toolkit promoting connectivity incorporating for the first time environmental criteria. Regular exchanges between BEREC and operators and strong involvement by national regulators in its governance

The European Union's regulatory authority (BEREC), due to its regular exchanges with operators and its strong involvement by national regulators in its governance, is best suited to address issues specific to electronic communications such as sustainability. The document discusses the importance of smartphones for accompanying these first initiatives. 
- Some key advantages for supporting these initiatives are that they are in line with the European Parliament’s resolution from 25 November 2020. 
- The Commission has published a recommendation entitled “The Green Pact for Europe” in December 2019, which aims to promote high-speed broadband investments and propose a toolkit to reduce the costs of deployment. 
- Point 3. (16) encourages member states to develop better practices and incentives in favour of reducing environmental impact during network deployment. 
- It is important to reinforce incentives for both economic actors and end users, beyond just network operators, to take into account the environmental impact of device replacement cycles often represented as a last resort. 
- As seen previously, smartphones have a significant impact on the environment with an estimated lifespan of 23 months181. The document discusses the various types of obsolescence and how to combat them.
- The effectiveness of limiting environmental impact for the sector was highlighted as being limited (3.3.1). 
- Publishers and online service providers are seen as key drivers in prolonging terminal life spans and digital services, which is an inseparable part of infrastructure networks for action. 
- Special attention was given to three types of obsolescence: material, caused by wear and tear; software, due to obsolete software versions; and cultural, stemming from users’ changing behaviour. 
- Information collected during the workshop should be used to build tools for regulating data usage in a context of increasing significance for electronic devices. This will help equip users with better consumption choices and enable providers to provide incentives that encourage sustainable practices. 80% of the carbon footprint of digital technology in France is from terminals.
- The aim is to make it more fashionable or due to the increase in digital technology in France: sufficient public policies to face the growth of usages? 
- Commercial practices or advertising incentives are needed to promote a renewal very rapidly. 
- The 2009 European Union directive on ecoconscious design applies at present only to “energy products” and does not include smartphones or TVs, but Commission has announced its intention to extend the directive’s scope during its 2020-2024 plan. 
- Users' habits need to be taken into account for them to have an effective power. If these advances are positive, the Authority cannot yet assess if they will be sufficient. Some large industrial and commercial actors have so far shown little inclination towards OS sustainability enhancements Instances where consumers have a real right to repair should probably be considered. 
- Concerning material obsolescence, the AGEC law will oblige companies to publish indicators of software reliability and durability for consumers. 
- It is probable that every digital service or application is susceptible of causing defects and applications can be influenced by the most visible actors in the digital sphere (public authorities, think tanks, NGOs). In order to adopt them systematically, manufacturers may put in place methodologies aimed at reducing their environmental impact. The measures appearing in an ecoconscious design could also be referred to as green design principles and could appear in the life cycle of a product, such as wear and tear on the battery.
-Good driving habits, especially for publishers with large dimension- ers, have been facilitated by workshops that have identified the need for specific environmental treatments for devices (e.g., designing products with an effect on the environment).
-Exchanges within workshops have allowed for the identification of specific needs related to device durability (avoiding capacitors that are increasingly diverse [TVs, appliances], and standardized components). This is crucial given that terminals aggregate a critical role in structuring device functions184. 
-Acting on mature OSes is therefore crucial to ensuring overall device durability. The use of modu- lable terminals, meaning ones where one can change components186, is critical for this purpose. un à un, permet de réduire les renouvellements anticipés.
- Ces logiques peuvent s’appliquer à l’ensemble des terminaux et il conviendra notamment de prendre en compte les 182 articles du Code de l’environnement.
- « Les producteurs, importateurs, distributeurs ou autres metteurs sur le marché d’équipements électriques objets connectés qui tendent et électroniques communiquent (…))] l’indice de réparabilité de ces équipements [(…)] ».
- A titre d’exemple, Let’s Encrypt estime qu’un tiers des smartphones Android seraient susceptibles de ne plus accepter ses certificats en 2021, impactant fortement le champ des contenus accessibles sur internet par les utilisateurs concernés. The document discusses the importance of actors and their impact on the environment.
-It is important that these transparency so that actors can make commitments, through a code of conduct, with third parties.
-A better performance, by reducing the interoperability of APIs (environmental interface for terminals via programming)185, would allow extending their life span. 
-Another measure often mentioned is distinguishing updates that must be installed automatically for long term device reliability from those that can be installed selectively for user convenience.
-Recycling is generally considered as a last resort because processing and disposal processes consume resources as well as limiting the efficiency of recycled materials. 
-The recycling industry remains constrained by its ability to efficiently manage resources and control emissions The document discusses the importance of terminals being able to access online content and services, given that each terminal will have a different choice at some point in its life and will need to resort to using days-of-life devices at some point. 
-The actors who are more virtuous environmentally will be able to benefit from this recycling process more than those who are not. For example, the Arcep has already had phases of design for recycling mobile devices multiple times, such as when it published a report on mobile devices in February 2018 called “Terminals: The Missing Link in the Open Internet”. 
-One of the issues identified during discussions about opening up the internet was emphasizing more the orientation of actors towards online content production. This is something that should be increased in order to incentivize actors to produce online content more often. "d’internet, février 2018."

-"Plusieurs initiatives qui pourraient permettre d’accroitre la confiance perception pour les utilisateurs du coût des utilisateurs dans ces circuits." The document discusses the 2019 public opinion on reconditioning terminals and how it has changed from 99.9% in charge of reconditioning in 2010189 to a positive trend for the next user of terminal.

-The key issue now is moving towards a dissociating sale of reconditioned terminals with generalization of the sale, which would reassure buyers about the terminal's long-term durability and subscription service.

-On this topic, Arcep thinks that she could bring and provide more detailed knowledge about practices involving malicious software installation on digital devices, which could be developed in a more in-depth way through public advertising campaigns. 

-The aim would be to make it easier for new models to emerge without relying on sales of terminals based on traditional marketing approaches (incitement to innovation, seeking novelty…) which have been successful so far. 

-Initiatives based on functionality rather than design are desirable as they will fuel future editions of Arcep's digital barometer. If given a mandate to do so, the Authority could develop specific models for distribution that would reduce incentives for device replacement through increased functionality and reduced advertising efforts by third parties. Participants at the workshops mentioned approaches such as environmental models that encourage contributors, obsolescence of cultural terminals, and lack of a virtuous model in itself. They also noted that it would not be sufficient to adopt a vigilance only approach, but also need to consider the implications of discontinuing service.
- One way to explore this possibility is through the provision of models that are environmentally friendly, such as rental schemes that reduce incentives for users to keep old terminals running if they are looking to purchase new ones. However, in the context of massification and the development of internet-of-things objects, this question deserves particular attention. According to Cisco, internet traffic in 2022 is expected to reach 4.8 Zettaoctet (Zo). 
- Encouraging responsible practices such as banding together of different types of content providers is also important. 
- CDNs are also important for distributing the content and applications from these platforms. 
- Netflix, Google, Amazon and Facebook are some of the most important actors in this space, and their size is increasing rapidly. CDN : Content Delivery Networks

- Les incitations des grands fournisseurs de service à réduire leur impact environnemental semblent limitées alors que leurs marges sont réelles. ou la qualité vidéo afin d’éviter une propagation de pratiques d’ écoconception sur les millions de sites internet créés représente pour eux le risque de dégradation de la qualité perçue par leurs utilisateurs vis-à-vis de leurs concurrents en cas d’effort unilatéral.
-Si un tel dispositif devait s’avérer insuffisant, il faudrait considérer des outils plus incitatifs.
-Parmi ces propositions, l’institution d’une taxe ou d’une tarification ayant une disproportionnée par rapport au gain escompté est régulièrement évoquée. The consumption number 16 in the report published by the Senate considers that a «tax on these entities could be created to encourage them to put in place a large number of practices that would allow for more manageable data». 
- The code of conduct for data usage – which would include good practices on the largest streaming video actors – would be subject to this tax. 
- The product and equipment used by these entities could fund the digital solidarity fund (DSF). In this case, Arcep, which already does this work in terms of territory development or training people for digital inclusion, could also contribute financially to maintaining internet infrastructure. 
- This measure would send a signal-price to consumers who are connecting across networks. Prin- D’autres initiatives parallèles pourraient être envisagées, notamment en optimisant mieux leur trafic.
- Comme évoqué plus haut, une telle hypothèse serait destinée aux FCA pour les accompagner dans l’écoconception de démarches de responsabilisation de type sites internet.
- Un guide qué plus haut, une telle stratégie aurait aussi pour objet d’aider les FCA à identifier les risques liés à l’usage d’internet.
- L’ensemble de ces démarches devrait s’inscrire en cohérence avec les travaux plus généraux sur l’ensemble des autres usages d’internet, notamment la conception des sites web, l’optimisation de la programmation des différentes fonctionnalités réseau ou applicatives avec des langages de programmation moins consommateurs en énergie.

Several data centers are placing today • The direct cooling with refrigeration adiabatic today, mechanisms for managing their environmental impact as much as possible. This impact varies depending on the size, servers and this system configuration, it is no longer necessary to pre-plan for group cold. When exceeding the target temperature, on-closing the adiabatic refroid- ering is possible. To reduce the environmental impact of a data center, it is possible to use the evaporation of water: hot and dry air passes through a moist exchange unit. The energy necessary for evaporation of water is extracted from the air which is then cooled in an adiabatic manner. With automatic systems, it is possible to obtain a stable temperature all year round, without reducing energy consumption from cooling units. It should be noted that refroid- ing can not work well when hot air is very humid but this situation is relatively rare. Traditionally,

It's now possible to have a stable temperature all year long without reducing temperature when hot air is very humid but this situation is relatively rare France has a frequent problem with data centers.
- The center uses air conditioning cabinets, located near the users, to reduce the impact on the environment.
- Another aspect to reduce the impact on servers is to use a cold room and inject cold air into the hot air circulating in data centers. 
- The heat is transported by data centers by means of an airtight circuit that leads to cold (today between 22°C and 30°C). 
- Free cooling allows for permanent refreezing of servers, which would significantly reduce the environmental impact of data centers. The document is about the ISO/IEC 30134-2:2016 standard for data centers.
- The document mentions that in order to take full advantage of the energy efficiency features of data centers, it is necessary that the ratio between energy used and energy delivered be in line with specificities of this sector and the nature of the data center's center of operations.
- If a data center is designed in accordance with good practices identified on current data centers, then legal obligations pertaining to environmental protection should also be taken into account.
- It remains to be seen whether European economic actors will take up this responsibility. The establishment of regulation through several proposals contained therein, including at the national level, appears to be the usefulness of allowing for actors (operators, manufacturers, distributors, service providers…) to better understand the current situation and identify the main issues affecting these actors in the ecosystem
-A collection of information could be used to help these actors understand their responsibilities in terms of data management practices and comply with relevant legal obligations
-The Arcep could establish a code of practice governing data management with regard to coverage by electronic communications infrastructure operators. Scaleway is the world’s leading provider of bare metal cloud services.
- The company announced that it has reached a new milestone with its most powerful server, the Bare Metal Server.
- This server is designed for use with extreme applications and can handle loads much greater than other servers.
- This announcement comes as part of Scaleway’s Ultimate Performance campaign.
- One of the goals of this campaign is to convince users to reduce their environmental impact by using more efficient data storage solutions.
- These observations show that government action should not be limited to economic incentives only, but should also focus on building user trust and confidence. 
- In order to mobilize all available resources, it is necessary to develop strategies involving both legal and economic measures. 
- It is more important to provide users with the necessary data than simply urging them to take action legally or economically. Sécurité juridique: assurer la protection des données personnelles et les droits de l’homme 
-Transmission de ces informations aux utilisateurs: faciliter l’accès à ces données, les mettre en capacité de réutiliser ces informations et peser sur le marché pour améliorer la qualité des services proposés
-Démarche en accompagnant le déploiement des outils existants ou en permet- tignantes, que ce soit par la diffusion de tant le développement de nouveaux outils que par la mise en ligne d’outils existants The document discusses ways that tools can be cited for detailed tutorials on this subject: agro-industrial repair, cosmetics and food sectors, « Openfoodfacts 199 » and « Yuka 200 » applications provide clear and precise information to users, accompanied by elements allowing them to choose products based on their needs.
-In terms of coverage and quality of service, « Mon réseau mobile 201 » or « Ma connexion internet 202 » developed by the Arcep provide users with knowledge of the coverage they will benefit from at various times in their lives (at home, at work...). A system of tools to measure quality is also being developed by the Arcep: a « Quality Observatory 203 ».
-The government could also consider launching an appeal for projects aimed at imagining and building these environmental regulation tools if public action was intensified in this direction. Other tools may emerge if no third initiative emerges to take up this responsibility.
-Other tools may be brought into existence if public action is focused on this area. An "environmental barometer" could be implemented which would value those actors making the most effort in this sphere. The document discusses the idea of « name and shine » (« naming and valorizing ») and, if necessary, highlighting problematic practices. This barometer would be developed based on data collected by public actors, in particular through indicators proposed by the Arcep to actors engaged in discussing and which are mentioned in part 3.1.2.
-112NOISULCNOC 113 is a summary of proposals from the Arcep 
-The aim of this orientation was to develop a better understanding of the significant environmental impact of a wide range of digital actors and those inclined to work towards becoming more ecologically conscious.
-It is the opinion of the Arcep that technology can play an important role in reducing carbon emissions, but should not give up on other possibilities for innovation and exchange while still taking into account people’s increasing awareness of their ecological responsibility. Obviously, there is no need to condemn digital usages: it is important to recognize that this technology covers a vast range of uses – some with an economic incentive – that must be taken into account when modifying people’s behavior The document discusses mobilizing the internet to reduce its environmental impact.
-The Arcep wants to find a middle ground between leaving it unregulated and using administra- tive economy.
-The main focus of the document is on getting the government to use its power to regulate the internet. The document discusses the level of ambition and in particular the trajectory that the digital sector should follow in order to fully participate in the low carbon strategy. It is also up to the political power to define, through law, the tools of transparency, incentive and constraint which will give shape to this regulation, as well as the institutions responsible for their mobilization.
-The Arcep's proposals are divided into three movements: (i) better understanding and monitoring environmental impact of different sectors and actors of digital technology by providing public authorities with solid instruments for strategic management, (ii) incorporating environmental issues into regulatory choices both when it comes to networks and mobile devices, (iii) increasing economic incentives - providers and users - through various policy levers. Here we only focus on public policy levers that fall within regulatory philosophy. The essential elements for environmental evaluation and follow-up of the sector's footprint are

- In addition: 
- Providers of content and applications, especially those with more structural power (e.g., around good practices such as adapting content resolution for screens or limiting autoplay). 
- System developers, especially those with more structural power (e.g., around good practices such as maintaining old versions or better integration of obsolescence issues into updates). 
- Operators of data centers (e.g., around good practices such as architecture of data centers, system optimization or managementof storage equipment...).

-The codes of conduct should be subject to regular monitoring by a public body with the power to impose sanctions if necessary.
-There should be an effort made towards "regulating by data" which would help develop tools for consumers to make informed choices about their impact on the environment.
-A "environmental barometer" could be created that gauges best practices across all digital ecosystems.

-Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are platforms used by content providers and applications to closer their content to the end user and improve quality of service and user experience, while having a global connection and reducing transport costs. 
-Reducing distance between clients and servers allows, generally, for latency reduction, increased performance, and reduced costs. 
-The concept of ecoconception has been internationalized at the level of ISO/TR 14062 in 2002 with the publication of the standard norm ISO/TR 14062. This standard specifies that ecoconception aims to "integrate environmental aspects into product design." The French government defined France's first Ecoconsellab guide on the subject in 1998 as FD X 30-310. ADEME played a significant role in this development as well as representing France internationally and ensuring its chairmanship of the ISO 14062 drafting committee. In 2009, Directive 2009/125/CE determined a framework for environmental requirements applicable to products related to energy, which defines ecoconception as "the integration of environmental characteristics into product design in order to improve performance environmentally throughout its life cycle." The ADEME website provides detailed information: https://www.ademe.fr/entreprises-monde-agricole/organiser-demarche-environnementale/dossier/ecoconcevoir-produits/. Edge computing: a technology that uses more localized data centers to handle less centralized data. 
-The "rebound effect" occurs when this technological improvement actually leads to an increase in energy consumption. 
-This paradox has been observed by W. Stanley Jevons over 150 years ago, and it is still being observed today by economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes. The introduction of Watt's steam engine, the total coal consumption in England has increased despite an efficient use of this technology. Watt's innovations made coal an energy source more affordable, which led to generalize the use of his steam engine within manufacturing industries increasing overall coal consumption. 
-At national level, emissions accounting does not take into account foreign sources (as opposed to the footprint). However, when considering direct and indirect emissions analyzed at the global level, emission and footprint correspond to the same thing. The ISO 14064-1 standard of 2006 specifies principles and requirements for measuring greenhouse gas emissions and their reduction. It includes requirements for design, development, management, reporting and verification of an organization's inventory of GHG emissions. It distinguishes direct greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1), indirect associated energy emissions (scope 2) and other indirect emissions (scope 3). The ADEME provides a very comprehensive definition of these scopes: https://www.bilans-ges.ademe.fr/fr/accueil/contenu/index/page/bilan%2Bges%2Borganisation/siGras/1
-Direct greenhouse gas emissions (or SCOPE 1): Direct GHG emissions originating from The document discusses the installation, fixes and mobile emissions of an organization located within its organizational boundaries.
-Emissions from sources controlled by the organization, such as combustion of fixed and mobile sources, industrial processes not involving combustion, emissions from ruminants, biogas from technical landfill centers, fluid leaks from chemical processing plants, agricultural fertilization with nitrogenous compounds, etc. are all included in this category.
-Indirect emissions associated with electricity production, heat production or imported steam for activities within the organization are also considered here.
-Other indirect emissions (SCOPE 3) resulting from activities within the organization are also taken into account. These might include purchases of resources like materials or services, employee movements, transport upstream and downstream of goods shipments, disposal management related to activities within the organization; production output including product life cycles; and environmental impact assessment of business decisions Codecs are programs that are used for the transformation of source files into new files.
- The development of more efficient codecs (and thus methods for encoding) allows for a savings in the amount of data necessary to disseminate a given quality file. 
- Primary energy: Primary energy represents the "potential" energy contained in natural resources (like wood, gas, oil, etc.) before any transformation. It differs from "final" energy because production processes, transport and transformation of resources often lead to losses. 
- Provider of content and applications (PFA): A company that provides multimedia or information technology services to its users through a network (usually the internet). 
- Greenhouse gas (GHG): These gases contribute to climate change and are one of the factors causing global warming. They encompass several gases among which water vapor, carbon dioxide or methane. For simplification purposes, GHGs and "carbon" (for CO2) are often used alternatively since CO2 present in the atmosphere and anthropogenic origin is responsible for most of the anthropogenic effect on climate and contributes according to the GIEC report 78% of global emissions between 1970 and 2010. The terms "GES" and "carbon" can be used interchangeably although the term "carbon" covers a narrower range than the term GES. Environmental impact of digitalization: A impact refers to an effect produced by something, in this case, the digital environment on environment. For the present report, the term "environmental impact" does not refer to more specific concepts such as "carbon footprint" or "emissions GES." Intensity carbon: According to INSEE, intensity in carbon is the ratio of emissions of CO2 to production of Internet-of-Things companies (IoT): Conceptually, the internet of things represents physical objects connected through digital identities and capable of communicating with each other. Technically, it consists of identifying digital directness and normalization (IP address, smtp protocol, http...) of a physical object using a wireless communication system that can be an RFID chip, Bluetooth device or Wi-Fi. Neutrality of the Net: The neutrality of the Net or network neutrality is a principle that guarantees equal treatment for all data flows on internet. This principle excludes for example any positive or negative discrimination in favor of source, destination or content transmitted over the network. End part of network: In FttH infrastructure up to subscriber (FttH),
the end part of network corresponds to The last portion of the network access and is located after the point of mutualization (PM). It represents the largest part of the network in cumulative kilometers and is entirely mutualized between electronic communications operators.
-Product category rules (PCRs): These are documents that specify predetermined rules for conducting an analysis of cycle life for a product category and determine the format of environmental declarations. They are essential for evaluating environmental impacts. 
-Power usage effectiveness (PUE): The PUE metric is used to evaluate energy efficiency of a data center. It represents the ratio between total energy used and necessary computing equipment within data center. 
-Network access: The network access refers to all means connecting telecommunications terminals to a switch in infrastructure network. In fixed broadband example, it usually refers to local loop segment between subscriber and Network Access Point (NAP) for fiber or NAP for copper if there is no fiber connection available at customer's premises. 
-Network collection: The network collection refers to part of infrastructure network, located downstream from network collection point and which ensures transport of signals between backbone networks and access networks. 
-Backbone networks: Backbone networks represent main part of infrastructure networks characterized by high bandwidth, which concentrates signals coming from other parts of the infrastructure networks and transports them between them or towards The telephone network commutated is the historical technology of fixed telephone service (phone plugged directly into the "T" outlet).
- Biotic resources: The adjective biotic means "without life." Biotic resources refer to elements such as water, rare earths, fossil fuels such as oil or any other resource, usually in limited quantities. 
- Small cells: Small cells or small mobile sites correspond to "mini-sites mobile" with low power and short range (about 100m). Operating system (OS): An operating system is a set of programs that allows you to direct the resources of a computer terminal. It also includes an user interface allowing it to interact with the computer terminal. More simply, it is a set of programs that allows one to operate and control an information appliance. 
- Beyond security and trust issues, are there commonalities between the two domains that warrant closer examination? What synergies might exist between Atelier partner specialists from both domains if necessary?
-"Cybersecurity risk and environmental risk" In order for this discussion on these questions to be opened by ANSSI's Workshop, it was articulated into three parts: a presentation of the approach (Jean-Bap-) 
124125plan environmental impact ? Does she have specific features deserving further examination? How can better manage cybersecurity impact without sacrificing ever greater ambition for security and digital trust? Are there any commonalities between the two domains that warrant closer examination? If so, what synergies might exist between Atelier partner specialists from both domains? Suite à l'invitation formulée par l'ARCEP, le 25 novembre 2020, un atelier a été organisé consacré aux principaux défis liés aux cybersécurités et à l'environnement.
- Les intervenants ont réuni une cinquantaine de personnes de France, d'Europe (ENISA) et du monde francophone.
- Les objectifs de cet atelier étaient d'explorer les liens entre cybersécurité et environnement, en commençant par la notion de « risque ». Durant which should she take the effort to construct more sustainable digital systems on the understanding of a fictitious and prospective article describing French cyber security complex interdependencies. She is expected to be successful in 2025, succeeding in managing her environmental impact with the help of experts from both environment fields -The interest generated by the two domains: public actors, businesses and civil society organizations coming together has led to new synergies being identified (fictitious article available on the ANSSI site). The participants were then invited to identify the main challenges that have been raised by public authorities and all relevant actors in cyberspace -In a last phase, each group was asked to imagine concrete solutions (working axes, initiatives, concepts etc.) necessary for achieving success in tackling previously identified cyber security challenges before deployment. The document discusses the need for an ecologic transition in digital technology and provides a number of solutions through group deliberations. 
- It is essential to its long-term development. The overall work in groups has - Beyond the digital world, that of a resilient society benefits from the support of an experienced (Lisa Allemand, division management security; Aline Barrault, systematization, ANSSI; Juliette Baron, strategic planning under direction of ANSSI; Camille Parmentier and Laurent Toustou, programme decision-makers especially within the cybersecure sector with regard to key challenges), leading to several adhesion between the two domains. 
- The workshop first allowed for the identification of risks affecting both society and economy due to uncontrolled cyber threats. In 2025 these risks could lead to a collapse of society or even an economic model. • Concepts and characteristics related in different contexts: The projection in 2025 based on current trends depicting a future where actors in cybersecurity and environment will face several critical challenges together. The document discusses the challenges and risks posed by human activities, including the three categories of challenges posed by technology: balancing environmental concerns with technological advances; managing cyber incidents; and training/sensitizing specialists in cybersecurity.
- The concept of crisis is used when events take on a significant scale, often beyond the boundaries of one state. The climate crisis is an example of a global crisis that began as a localized issue.
- The challenge of protecting ecosystems from cyberattacks (e.g., defending against cyberattacks) is also complex and logical, requiring data sharing to enable regulation through data. Cybersecurity is ambitious on the physical security side, but proportionate in terms of equipment (e.g. overheating of data during a heatwave). 
- The "minimalism" approach might be inspired by particular domains of cybersecurity and environmental transition sub-issues, in particular energy conservation and carbon footprint reduction. 
- It is important to consider synergies between cybersecurity and environmental issues, in order to avoid having to make too many compromises between them. For example, it may be possible to develop complementary techniques that would protect both information systems and the environment simultaneously. The challenge of identification of research and development centers dedicated to environmental cybersecurity -opening the way to secure digital solutions, or secure industrial systems -by contributing, by design, in a sustainable way: for example, avoiding some risks for the environment (for example, preventing computer sabotage).
-From these challenges, several practical ideas were proposed by different groups. For instance, they included placing technological devices such as bots connected to networks constituting part of cyberthreats. Energy consumption should be one of the measures recommended in order not to compromise cybersecurity ambition while achieving sustainability goals.
-It is necessary to take into account environmental impacts in the construction of cybersecurity systems. Solutions should be proposed that allow for an efficient use of resources while ensuring security. For instance, substituting air travel with distance-based electronic technologies would contribute to secure cybersecurity without diminishing cybersecurity ambition on materiality issues like energy production and security. The challenge of improving cybersecurity assessments is discussed in this document. 
- Among other things, the authors explore ways to cooperate with businesses on specific environmental issues, such as climate change. 
- The authors also emphasize the need for precise evaluation of the environmental impact of different cyber security solutions, in order to ensure that they are designed in a sustainable way. 
- In addition, the authors propose engaging public sector agencies in dialogue about specific cyber security challenges (such as BYOD). 
- Finally, the paper encourages and supports initiatives by all relevant actors when it comes to online ecosystems and cyber attacks. The document discusses digital waste and how to think about a concept that would unite different concepts of "security by design," "privacy by design," and "sustainability by design."
