In 2019, the percentage of smartphones in French households surpassed the percentage of computers. This increase in digital usage has led to uncontrolled growth in our use and impacts of technologies, with 44% of French citizens believing that the digital world is a threat to the environment. In reality, electronic devices are responsible for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The impact on local environments is even more pronounced as Nantes' economy has largely transitioned to a tertiary sector, with an increasing number of jobs in information technology over the past few years. To make matters worse, we are currently experiencing a health crisis caused by widespread use of digital technologies: sudden intensification of work-from-home, explosion in online orders, and rapid deployment of 5G. Digital technologies present an opportunity to reduce our environmental footprint relative to traditional workplace travel or paperless document management. However, this opportunity is only beginning to be realized at local levels; much more needs to be done before we can say that electronic devices have had a significant negative impact on climate change globally or locally within France. In order to assess the environmental impact of different digital solutions more systematically and compare them against previous solutions options, it is important that policymakers understand how these technologies affect local ecosystems and public services. This summary explores factors contributing to electronic device's global environmental impact as well as identifying policy levers for actors involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from territorial development Digital technologies are responsible for increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, but advances in energy efficiency technologies could help offset some of these issues. Municipalities are key players in digital society and responsible for public policies that rely on digital tools and massive data sets to design, regulate or offer new services to the population. In Loire-Atlantique department in France, for example, policymakers decided to equip only disadvantaged students due to budgetary constraints and environmental concerns related to data storage capacity. Managing information overload within public services is a challenge as physical infrastructure becomes increasingly digitized and reliant on automated systems. The text discusses the growing trend of local data storage, and how this has created tension between the need to keep sensitive information safe and the increasing demand for such data. In 2021, the Department of Health will hold a day dedicated to cleaning up digital data. This is in addition to other initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of digital data that needs to be stored in the first place. The threefold strategy of "Avoiding, compensating, and reducing" is likely to become increasingly important when it comes to projects related to digital technology in the near future. Awareness among citizens about the impact of their online activities is important if we are hope- ful of achieving a sustainable level of digital wastefulness. It is up to us as individuals - especially those who are most impacted by technology -to take action and educate ourselves on its consequences.

At present, legislation obligates internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile operators alike to report their carbon footprints annually from January 2020 onwards. In 2022, one in five French people owns devices that are not functional or sleeping, and they keep them mainly because of the lack of practical access or knowledge about recycling processes. A local cycle-of-life strategy for digital equipment at the territorial level may involve a schematic plan for device volume, frequency of replacement, and existence of recycling networks. Local organizations developing these networks fall within the scope of municipal actions aimed at reducing environmental impact from digital technology. However, while these actors are increasingly taking proactive measures to reduce their environmental impact, they continue to create new uses and are seen as responsible for energy consumption beyond what is necessary.

In 2019, 41% of respondents said that mitigating the environmental impacts caused by digital technology was an urgent issue due to increasing usage levels. Meanwhile, 31% argued that it was an issue due to growing energy demands associated with increased use of digital technologies. Municipalities have a role to play in supporting sustainable economic development through initiatives such as improving energy efficiency or promoting renewable energy production. The text discusses the importance of environmental assessment, and how it can be used to test new solutions in the field of each public policy. On the territory of Nantes Metropolitan Area, the Nantes City Lab initiative offers project holders the opportunity to experiment with their large-scale natural solutions in the city. A more systematic evaluation of projects would allow judging the potential benefits and environmental impacts of tested solutions. Technological choices will determine our future means of action.

MOST IMPORTANT POINTS: 



1) Environmental assessment is an important tool that can be used to test new solutions in the field of public policy. 
2) The Nantes City Lab initiative offers project holders the opportunity to experiment with their large-scale natural solutions in the city. A more systematic evaluation of projects would allow judging the potential benefits and environmental impacts of tested solutions. 
3) Technological choices will determine our future means of action, so municipalities should rely on fundamental knowledge when making decisions about digital transformation. Digital technologies are constantly evolving, and their impact on the environment is growing. Education is important in order to understand how digital technologies are impacting the environment, but awareness alone will not be sufficient to manage them effectively.

Some recommendations for managing digital technologies' impact on the environment include developing a detailed understanding of where they're being used and how they're impacting the environment, mapping out locations where energy resources are being consumed, assessing the environmental impacts of different digital technologies in comparison to current practices, and educating users about their environmental responsibilities. It is also important to consider ways to reduce or offset the environmental impact of digital technologies when possible.
