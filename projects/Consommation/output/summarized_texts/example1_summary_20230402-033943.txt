Le groupe est tiennent pas compte des progrès du numérique réuni depuis 2017 par l’ANRT dont la présidence y compris dans la manière de s'en servir.
Le problème demeure mais nos travaux montrent de quoi il l'est moins dans les secteurs applicatifs que à l'analyse des enjeux technologiques liés dans celui du numérique lui même. The problem is that if we don’t react, the countries who will master this revolution will be those who are able to control the interaction between electronics and products. 
-France and Europe are facing a double problem: they need to manage the digital chain and the application sectors have to have the competent personnel to design, operate and maintain electronic equipment in their designs, functions and maintenance. 
-The technologies have improved a lot. This has contradicted the pessimistic predictions like one published in Forbes in 1999 which claimed that by 2010 half of American electricity production would be consumed by digital economy and Internet. 
-It is difficult to make predictions because of the speed with which demand, TIC effectiveness, and how they are used evolve. The methods and assumptions vary depending on organizations. Extreme results get communicated a lot but these results come from simplified models. For example, for data center consumption (DC), these models give results that are two times higher than what is likely (200-350 TWh). 
-To contain consumption and emissions levels will require a large investment in research and development. And if we want to reduce as much as possible their direct impact on technology’s emissions, most impacts on emissions will come from applications within other sectors (electricity, transport, building...), although employment may ultimately reduce its consumption level and total emissions The digital economy is having a global impact on energy consumption, but it is difficult to quantify - Data center and mobile consumption are increasing significantly while that of appliances decreases - The manufacturing of ICT equipment accounts for today 40% of the total global impact of the digital age - The carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by a product or activity. - ICT and E&M sectors together account for more than 60% of world GDP. - Equipment durability reduces its environmental impact. - Regulations and standards exist, notably on planned obsolescence. Internet traffic will continue to increase rapidly - Energy consumption for the digital age is difficult to measure because there is an evolving methodology and lack of reliable data - Equipment manufacturing would account for 40% of the total global impact if it were not for the power consumed by devices themselves Cycle de fonctionnement du processeur : « ferme » sur un mécanisme d’effacement pour rapporter la valeur de l’information acquise à l’énergie qui lui a été allouée. 
- Loi de Moore décrit le nombre de transistors sur une puce de silicium double tous les deux ans. 
- La loi de Koomey décrit le nombre de calculs par Joule dépensé chaque année. Koomey est une extrapolation des lois de Moore, qui prévoit que les ordinateurs auront atteint l’extrapolation à la fin de 2020. 
- Les limites de la loi de Moore sont décrites ci-après : les premiers signes d'essoufflement apparaissent depuis le milieu des années 2000 - 2010. Microprocessors are able to dissipate a lot of energy.
-The limits imposed by the power dissipated and the integration density valid as long as measurements are not made complicate further progress in terms of miniaturization of transistors. Quantum transistors are composed of two thin wires that are located at a physical distance limited.
-Quantum bits are capable of being "coherent", which means they have an state that corresponds to the value of their own vector. The quantum world is a branch of science that studies the laws of quantum physics.
-Calculating quantum requires a lot of energy because operations on basic states require it.
-Quantum "doors" are reversible and only transfer a very small amount of energy. Oracle allows you to change the sign of the coefficient today.
-From the subscriber who originally had the telephone number given to them. Thereafter, they must apply a series of operations: 
-Calculating quantum would theoretically be able to: 
-Factorize very large numbers (cryptography: algorithm Shor); be inverted (following Grover's algorithm). 
-Find the minimum energy configuration (the system is "almost certainly" in chemistry or the desired state in biology; performing again the same operation). Optimizing systems very complex: parallelizing it on two computers, finance, networks for all sorts or purposes, quantum systems with identical physics Processing power is a measure of how fast a computer can do calculations.
- Moore's law says that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit has been doubling every two years, which has allowed computers to get faster and faster.
- Today, there are processors that can do calculations without getting faster, called "universal processors." However, these processors would be more expensive to make.
- Specialization of processors means that different parts of the computer have to be designed simultaneously while universal processors could be made separately. The latency, or time it takes for a message to be transmitted from one point to another, is related to the calculation power and system organization.
-There are two types of architectures: those with hierarchical network topologies and those with dispersed nodes.
-The European Union has set standards for 5G networks, based on the edge architecture.
-La complexité algorithmique dépend de la quantité de données à traiter.
-La plateformisation permet aux usagers d’accéder à des puissances de traitement qu’ils ne pourraient pas se payer.
-But the platform can also have an adverse effect: data ownership or access rights. FOG computing is an architecture that allows you to specialize support of IoT applications and services, in particular for connected vehicles. 
-The challenge is then to put in place measurement tools that allow understanding energy consumption of computing (millions of processors with entire systems). Edge computing is a set of technologies that allow organizations to perform complex and varied tasks from a small number of servers located at the edge of the network, avoiding system congestion. 
-FOG are specialized companies in data processing and preparation. 
-FOG is different depending on whether you seek security or speed. Universal processor is gradually disappearing Le parallélisme est le futur du processeur.
-Le processeur universel a été miniaturisé et il a pu être augmenté sa performance tout en diminuant sa consommation d’énergie, mais ensuite il a fallu arrêter l’augmentation de fréquence car la chaleur à dissiper devenait trop importante. Pour continuer à avancer, on doit recourir à la spécialisation et au parallélisme.
-Les programmes actuels ne sont pas faciles à programmer et doivent être réécrits pour tirer parti du parallélisme. De l'apprentissage, soit des modèles dits hybrides qui sont des modèles physiques plus simples couplés à des modèles technologiques (catalogue de convertisseurs d’énergie, catalogue de moyens de stockage à consommation générale du numérique sont court et long terme). Connaissant ces données, on détermine l’installation optimale, notamment que c’est vrai depuis les débuts du numérique.
-Les unités de production, les moyens de stockage, etc., doivent répondre aux demandes en énergie des entreprises. C’est un enjeu majeur pour elles. Carbon is used to produce energy.
-Environmental and social criteria must be integrated into energy choices in order to serve servers. 
-It is difficult to find an optimum reasonable (near CPU performance) in a short time using CPU. The volume of data to be processed is excessive. 
-Data should be reduced by creating public and private data types. 
-The efficiency, security of data, and real time effectiveness must be taken into account when choosing an energy source. 
-Gas is a fossil fuel and thus constrained by constraints on transitioning between many disciplines and exchanges. 
-Charcoal and renewable energy solutions; hydrogen systems for information will be constrained by a renewable resource and low carbon in industrial, or even transportation sector views. 
-The third axis concerns improving biogas etc. -Energy efficiency of infrastructure must be considered when designing new mobile generations. In practical terms, sectoral integration (ISE) features: gains across other sectors using energy resources in multiple ways . • A multi-vectorial approach to ensuring decarbonization, safety 
• The last axis concerns reducing consumption, resilience, and managing energy use Cybersecurity is an important topic, and it's necessary to sensitize users to the risks and importance of backup.
- The main findings and recommendations related to cybersecurity are as follows:
- The pace of changes leads to new vulnerabilities that need to be protected against, security measures are the best practices, but always lagging behind threats;
- Energy systems are no longer linear, but passing through different actors.
- Today still lagging behind threats; energy systems are no longer linear, but passing through different actors. Additional spending on increased costs may reach equal value; systemwide continuity is essential. A controlling and optimizing of interconnections between energy systems, communication networks and industrial sectors is necessary; 
- Harmonizing cybersecurity regulations is an important step in the right direction; 
- There is a lack of qualified personnel to manage cyber risks effectively. Significant investment in theoretical and practical training is needed. Electronic components are mainly manufactured by French companies. 
- Industry representatives are working on issues related to consumer consumption and energy efficiency for electronic products. 
- The CEA - Leti has a plan for reducing consumption by one thousandth within 10 - 15 years with its action plan on intelligent technology development. The CEA - Leti is responsible for designing and developing applications and systems related to artificial intelligence The need for local processing means that a lot of communication is needed (with information; low frequency).
-To equip microcontrollers with integrated communication systems, and means of security embedded, with multiple homogeneous cores (data centers), installing inference processors with a multiplicity of cores is necessary.
-It is neuronal in local networks (neuronal networks are easier to program, but do not learn and process information well at scale).
-One challenge is to increase the memory capacity so that operations can be performed on it. Today, energy consumption is mainly due to communication between processors and memory. However, we have observed that processor designs based on integrated circuits with many cores are not always specialized, the most efficient being multicores and manycores. 
-Kalray builds processors based on manycore processors which are partially analog and not digital. The European Commission (EC) has proposed a new renewable energy market report, which could weigh up to 6% of the GDP during the next decade.
-There are various levers to promote renewables, but their concentration in data centers poses a threat to local systems as well as the transformation of the European economy.
-Projections show that by 2030, data centers could account for 30% of electricity consumption in Denmark and Ireland, and 20% in France and Germany.
-The document discusses the various types of lighting used in data centers, and how each type has its own pros and cons.
-Overall, the document notes that while there are some very middling results from traditional lamps and incandescent bulbs, LED technology is finally starting to show real promise in terms of energy efficiency. However, it's still not perfect - for example, LEDs tend to be less efficient when used near windows or other light sources. The European Processor Initiative is a program designed to help Europe become more competitive in the field of processors.
-One goal of the program is to develop " hyperscale" data centers, which are significantly more energy efficient than earlier generations of facilities.
-The PUE for this machine is 1.4, meaning that it uses 44 million watts of energy.
-This machine can reach 75% renewable energy usage by 2025.
-OVH plans to install 10 million green computing nodes in France over the next two years. The purchase agreements for artificial intelligence processors are scheduled for 2023.
-The energy consumption of artificial intelligence processors is a major issue, and it will need to be taken into account when designing new data centers.
-Intel has decided to catch up with Samsung and TSMC in terms of technology development, in order to lead a more open policy towards its customers. This combination could result in growth in the consumption of energy while reducing carbon emissions. EDF is looking to develop energy technologies such as IoTs in order to reduce time it takes to process and respond to problems related to digital storage.
-For distribution, EDF is looking for market dominance by adapting its network to meet new uses and decentralized production.
-The impact of digital on functions necessary for reference data production (production and energy consumption) is significant. Security of participants, deployment of IoTs to serve carbon dioxide reduction throughout the whole economy, assistance to participants, industrial, personnel and public certification of tests and productions at all levels are among the benefits that come with digitalization. Edge computing goes in the direction of responsibility which shortens decision times and eliminates network congestion. Regarding nuclear power, the objective is increase life span of nuclear plants safely while building future power plants and dismantling old nuclear sites. RTE is looking for ways to reduce electric line overloads.
-Electric lines are inefficient, and in addition, developing energy management services around data characteristics of the grid operators.
-Cybersecurity requirements are strong: RTE must establish a transparent exchange with actors, but also apply privacy by design principles.
-RTE is striving to minimize storage of RTE information. 
-The digital age has enabled the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) to manage the network. 
-Various measures have been taken to reduce electricity consumption. 
-Network architecture must be adapted to constraints such as "time variability," "co-simulation," and "minute actions." 
-Automated devices can change network topology, which increases the risk of widespread power outages. 
-Automated devices can also use robustness when faced with losses in posts. 
-Removing production from EnR and allowing greater flexibility on the electrical grid are two main levers for automated devices The introduction of electronic fuel injection in 1984 led to a number of rare events.
-The processors that control the driving of autonomous cars are called neuromorphic.
-This has led to an increase in performance by 10%.
-Autonomous vehicles equipped with lidars (a type of radar), cameras, and sensors have seen a 27% increase in number since 2017.
-However, this has not prevented the growth of emissions from autonomous vehicles. 
-The growth of electric and hybrid engines will have a direct impact on thermal vehicles, losing market share. 
-The total number of kilometers traveled could decrease by 30 to 40%. 
-Gains in research and development related to self-driving cars must be strengthened. The development of safe artificial intelligence costs more to design and is more expensive when it comes to energy efficiency. 
-The needs for calculation are greater than those for common applications. 
-Electric and electronic vehicle architecture has a positive environmental impact, allowing for further progress in reducing air travel’s environmental footprint. 
-Recognition software poses a threat to self-driving systems because it can decode signals sent by the vehicle. 
 -Airbus’s technological goal is to create tools that will connect the network and erase The economic objective of the smart grid is to find a viable model for it. 
- The goal of BIM is to bring all concerned parties together for a construction project: conception, execution, and control. 
- Regulatory objectives are to determine the conformity between design and current rules. Digital actors, energy, and real estate have been brought together for projects. 
- Challenges faced with the Batignolles example are: 
- Collected digital, energy, and real estate actors; 
- Playing field has widened with residential area. Project was funded entirely by private funds with a very low budget for demonstration purposes. 
- Goal of project was to improve network performance and global information management. 
- Difficulties encountered were overcome through efforts provided by involved actors (network operators, social housing providers). A digital model of the neighborhood was also built. Collective action is more effective than individual action. This requires discipline in using these modes at specific times and demands tracking of residents (through blockchain technology already in place). 
- Main positive consequences are reduced consumption (car, airplane, building), efficiency of uses (autonomous cars would save 30%). Digital technology is having a significant impact on energy consumption, with Europe falling behind in terms of innovation. 
-Europe needs to be more efficient in its use of energy and develop a more sustainable economy. 
-Digital technology requires fast calculations that don’t use too much energy, which is why Airbus has been able to maintain control of its “Skyways” service used by many airlines. Energy companies and their suppliers are key players in the development and implementation of these projects. The issue of climate change is clearly identified as one of the major problems to be solved. 
-The significant differences between studies on this topic represent an important gap that needs to be filled. France has advantages, for example, as a result of a global measure. 
-Research needs to be present at all stages of the data chain in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the issues involved. This knowledge should be used to push forward the European processor initiative, in particular by developing distributed algorithms and aiming for 2030 goals of 65-70% energy consumption from renewable sources (where it is already evident that European supply will be insufficient); - increasing peer-to-peer exchanges, such as those involving bitcoin, and designing european standards or blockchain protocols should not be generalizable; this would require overseeing the diversity growing as the square of the number of national transcriptions; - Having a global understanding of the issues involved will allow us to optimize all aspects of cost-performance-wise systems; - Imposing recyclability and prohibiting planned obsolescence in environmental systems; - Developing systems "just enough," taking into account all constraints. Maintaining computer security is important.
- Developing new applications software to take advantage of parallelism and specialized components will be pursued.
- Networks of neurons, neural computation, and artificial intelligence will also be studied for autonomous or shared vehicles.
